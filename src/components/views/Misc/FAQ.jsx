              WSO (Williams Students Online) is a student organization devoted
              to creating innovative and useful computer-based services and
              offering them to the Williams College community. WSO was founded
              in 1995 and continues to play an important role in the campus
              community today.

            <h4>List Administrators</h4>
            <p>
              Please note that as a result of a recent server move, access to
              administrator accounts has been reset.
              <strong>&nbsp;Create an account on the new site&nbsp;</strong>
              to gain access to your listserv administrator powers again. If you
              still cannot gain access to your list, contact a WSO adminstrator.

            <h4>What&#39;s this?</h4>
            <p>
              We have recently implemented a new anti-spam technique to try and
              reduce the amount of spam on student listservs. As well, we have
              decided to move away from the old listserv software to improve
              ease of use. However, the new software does not allow for the
              migration of credentials from the old dashboard. As a result, you
              will need to make new ones. Our apologies.

              We removed the Old Willipedia link from our header in production
              in April 2025. Old Willipedia was permanently sunset during Winter
              Study 2026 for security reasons.
