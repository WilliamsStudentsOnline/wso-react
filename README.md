# WSO-React

This repository contains all the front-end code to the Williams Student Online web-app. Core technologies include [React](https://reactjs.org/) (bootstrapped with [Create React App)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react), and [Router5](https://router5.js.org/).

* Production Build: https://wso.williams.edu/
* Development Build: https://wso-dev.williams.edu/

## Contributing

TBD

## Getting Started

**1) Check for your Node version**
```
$ node -v
```
If the above command results in an error, download the latest Node version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).


**2) Check for your Yarn version**
```
$ yarn -v
```
If the above command results in an error, download the latest Yarn version [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

**3) Clone the repo into your working directory**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/WilliamsStudentsOnline/wso-react.git

or

$ git clone git@github.com:WilliamsStudentsOnline/wso-react.git
```
**4) Install the necessary dependencies**
```
$ yarn
```
You should be all set! To get started, run 
```
$ yarn start
``` 
to launch a development build, which includes Hot Module Reload(HMR), where changes you make will be instantly reflected without having to restart the server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Development

**Optional Installations:**
To aid in your development process, we also suggest installing the following:
* React Developer Tools ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/react-devtools/))
* [Redux DevTools](http://extension.remotedev.io/#installation)

**Styling**
Styling is currently done via vanilla CSS, although we will likely be moving to a React component library soon (see [issue #2](https://github.com/WilliamsStudentsOnline/wso-react/issues/2)).

**Where to begin:**
* Start by reading the section on contributing to find out the ways you can contribute to this repository. Contrary to popular belief, contributions need not come in the form of code. Fixing typos, creating issues for bugs, adding comments, suggesting tutorials, and helping out the community are valued ways of contributing.
* If you're interested in learning more about React and Redux, we recommend [this tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-redux-tutorial/#react-redux-and-x-tutorial).
* Look out for issues labelled as 'good first issue' [here](https://github.com/WilliamsStudentsOnline/wso-react/labels/good%20first%20issue). These issues are usually what we have deemed to be great places to get your feet wet 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
