Through exploration of the genealogy, disciplinary diversity, and evolution of the field, we will examine the depth and range of experiences of African-descended peoples throughout the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa. We will also give some attention to how members of the Diaspora remember and encounter Africa, as well as their diverse responses to the history of enslavement, colonialism, apartheid, racism, and globalization. Through materials that embrace both historical and contemporary perspectives, we seek to help students develop critical frameworks for understanding African diasporic experience while simultaneously illumining disjunctures and challenges for the field. This course features two pedagogical strategies: 1) a rotational, interdisciplinary approach that includes the expertise, methods, and specializations of Africana faculty; and 2) the incorporation of aesthetic materials--film, photography, music, dance, performance, and artwork--to enhance student ability to draw ongoing connections between visual and textual sources covered in the course. Close textual analysis, vibrant debate, and engaging discourse are expected.",

      "descriptionSearch": "The practice of colorism, or skin color discrimination, is very familiar to people of color globally. Often described as intra-racial racism, colorism within the Black American context is part of the colonial legacy of institutionalized slavery where the vestiges of white supremacy have created color castes among Blacks that still, to this day, have serious consequences for those on the darkest end of the color spectrum. The impact of this practice is far-reaching, influencing everything from romantic partnering, economic and educational attainment, and perceptions of beauty, attractiveness, and criminality. Although the vast majority of colorism scholarship is empirically based, there is much that we can glean from a literary investigation of this practice by analyzing the works of renowned writer, theorist, and folklorist Toni Morrison. Her work is particularly useful in examining issues of skin color, as this topic has been persistent yet underexplored in Morrison's writings. Employing the methods of literary and rhetorical criticism, this tutorial will investigate five Morrison novels, The \u003cem\u003eBluest Eye\u003c/em\u003e (1970), \u003cem\u003eSula\u003c/em\u003e (1973), \u003cem\u003eSong of Solomon\u003c/em\u003e (1977), \u003cem\u003eLove\u003c/em\u003e (2003) and \u003cem\u003eGod Help the Child\u003c/em\u003e (2015), and some of her non-fiction writings. In our discussions of each text, we will examine the problem of the \"color complex\" at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class and sexual violence, and how the characters manage these overlapping issues. We will bring the novels into conversation with social science articles on the practices of colorism in daily life. Because the tutorial blends different kinds of investigations into colorism, it will equip first year students with tools to critically engage and interrogate fictional literature; help them identify the real and nuanced ways that color discrimination affects Black communities; and consider how Morrison, one of our foremost writers, bridges literary creativity with ethnographic observation.",

From colonial-era propaganda newsreels about Africa's 'fighting men' to contemporary white-savior narratives that exploit current socio-political ruptures on the continent for epic effect, films about Africa produced by a primarily Western cinematic regime have proven themselves to be highly effective apparatuses for framing \"Africa\" as a concept to be summoned time and time again to tell different stories for different audiences, and in doing so privilege particular viewpoints and imaginaries. This tutorial will provide a space for robust discussion and debate about the various representative tropes, conceptualizations, and visualizations that have been used to shape the contours of \"Africa\" as understood by a primarily Western audience from past to present, and how these same tropes in many ways have come to define the nature of the relationship between film / cinema and the continent over the history of their engagement. In doing so, it will also address how strategic displays and narratives deployed by cinematic productions often support specific power dynamics that locate an idea of \"Africa\" within paradigms of specific cultural and political understanding. In zeroing in on how such films promote targeted realities for people and places within the continent, this tutorial will address how \"Africa\" in Western film and cinematic traditions is positioned within a particular framework of understanding that is more often than not irrevocably tethered to a Western imaginary.",

      "descriptionSearch": "The historical relationship between race and capitalism is one of the most enduring debates in U.S. historiography, shaping modes of inquiry and analysis across history, law, economics, sociology, anthropology, and other fields. This course seeks to introduce students to the concept of \"racial capitalism\"--which rejects treatments of race (and racism) as external to the so-called real workings of capitalism--as a way to understand this relationship and as an activist hermeneutic through which to identify and respond to the conditions that American Studies must reckon with. Students will gain familiarity with the global history of racial capitalism and the power of the concept itself through secondary sources and a wide range of primary sources, and through engaged discussion and short essays. Throughout the course, we will pay special attention to the cultural politics, political geographies, and historical development of racial capitalism, thus attending to how the social relations of racial capitalism have been known, lived, and resisted across time and space. The course is organized around three key themes: the land question; race, capitalism, and nation; and the banalities of racial capitalism. Across these themes, the course will address such issues and topics as North American settler colonialism, circum-Caribbean plantation slave and \"Coolie\" labor, mass incarceration, the subprime mortgage crisis, and the War on Terror. The course will do so through and against a history of racial capitalism that privileges the U.S. nation-state in particular. By the end of this course, students should be able to: detail and analyze the historical development of and resistance to racial capitalism, doing so in relation to the global itineraries of racial slavery, settler colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy; trace the history of the concept of racial capitalism itself; and identify how the concept continues to shape the field of American Studies.",

With the creation of social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more recently TikTok, connecting with the world is literally one click, or selfie away. Though much of the attention around social media is focused on people with race and educational privilege, people of color have created their own spaces to curate, articulate, and produce culture. Through the methods of rhetorical criticism, critical discourse analysis, cultural criticism and ethnography, we will investigate the ways Africana cultures, specifically in the United States, utilize social media to shape community and influence popular culture. This course will give students hands-on experience analyzing various texts, and a deeper understanding of rhetorical methodologies.",

This course challenges what we dominantly understand as activism---key to the emergence of ethnic studies and feminist and queer theory. Moving away from political actions centered in these fields, such as strikes, protests, and boycotts, this course will turn to visual and performance art works by artists of color, who consider other forms of action that are not overtly visible, resistant, oppositional, agentive, militant, loud, liberatory, and documentable. Each week, we will examine a performance at the limit of action, including silence, sexual abjection, concealment, melancholia, and waiting, alongside issues related to race, gender, sexuality, labor, and migration among others. How might we approach and reconcile with performances that once again reify notions of racialized and gendered bodies as apolitical, passive, submissive, and compliant? Drawing on scholarship within black and women of color feminist criticism, queer of color critique, critical ethnic studies, and performance studies, this course will attune students to the role of aesthetics to interrogate and expand what we typically conceive of as activism, resistance, power, and survival from racialized, feminized, and queer positions.",

Each unit, we will study key scholarship that centers reproduction, slavery, care and domestic work, indentured servitude, sex work, and low wage flexible labor, to name a few, alongside queer and feminist modes of performance that respond to and/or provide strategies to live and survive under racial capitalism.

Many, however, are unaware of the decades-long cinematic movement to which Dash belongs. In this course, we will devote our critical inquiry to the creative output of the L.A. Rebellion, a group of Black cinematic artists trained at the UCLA Film and Television School between the 1960s and 1990s. Our visual journey will take us through a diverse set of filmmakers like Charles Burnett, Ben Caldwell, Barbara McCullough, Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Haile Gerima, Alile Sharon Larkin, Billy Woodberry, among many, many others, and how they sought to not only redefine the Black image on-screen but also reimagine the infinite possibilities of Blackness. We will pay close attention to the heterogeneity of genres, styles, and techniques that they put into practice from narrative to neorealism to documentary to avant-garde/experimental to African and African American musical and storytelling traditions. We will explore the various social and political issues that were represented by their films including: racial and class oppression, Black feminisms, Black Power, Afrocentrism, anti-colonialism and decolonization, police brutality and mass incarceration, radical social movements and coalition building, and the importance of community-based art and film practices. Finally, we will touch upon some of the recent works that have been inspired by the L.A. Rebellion, including the aforementioned \u003cI\u003eLemonade\u003c/I\u003e and Barry Jenkins' \u003cI\u003eMoonlight\u003c/I\u003e (2016).

      "descriptionSearch": "The ending of the Second World War in 1945 coincided with the dawn of a new nationalism in the modern Caribbean. The British territories were beginning their shift away from colonialism and charting a path toward independence that would arrive in the early 1960s. Their independent neighbors contended with US imperialism which greatly shaped questions of race, nationalism, and sovereignty. By the 1960s much of the region faced crises that grew out of the tensions of the postwar period. This course examines closely these transformations in the Caribbean. It is divided into three parts. The course begins with an examination of the ideas about race, state development and empire that dominated Caribbean intellectual discourse of the 1940s. Key texts for this period include the works of Caribbean intellectuals such as Roger Mais, Una Marson, CLR James, and Jacques Roumain who considered the possibilities of racial equality and democracy in the postcolonial Caribbean. The course then looks more closely at 1950s attempts to forge greater Caribbean unity during the early Cold War years. West Indian Federation and the circuits of travel within the Caribbean are given special focus. Finally, the course will discuss challenges of the postcolonial Caribbean by looking at the circumstances and wider responses to regional radicalism in the 1960s. The key events that will be examined in this section include the Duvalier dictatorship, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and black power in Jamaica in 1968.",

Anchored in the contexts of U.S. colonialisms, racialization, and accumulation, this course aims to expose students to the cultural politics of \"nature\" as a way of \"doing\" American Studies. Specifically, this course investigates formations of and struggles against U.S. colonialisms, racialization, and accumulation via the many symbolic and material iterations, negotiations, and contestations of the contingent relations between and among human and non-human natures. Organized around a significant research paper and weekly written responses, this course ultimately aims to foster students' critical writing, reading, analytical thinking, and comparative inquiry skills across such contexts and sites of contestation, and across texts of different genres and media. We will work with a wide range of primary sources, including published fiction and poetry, legal documents, newspaper articles, speeches, recorded songs, and films, photos, paintings and other visual culture. By the end of this course, students should be able to describe the historical foundations of dominant ideas, attitudes, and practices toward non-human natures, as well as analyze how ideas of \"nature\" mediate the ways in which colonial, racial, gender, and sexual categories and structures inform and are (re)produced by U.S. institutions and in public areas such as the law, public policy, and property. Finally, students should be able to interpret how racialized and colonized peoples' visions, representations, and practices of liberation with regard to relations with non-human natures and the materiality of land precede, contend with, and exceed normative political, economic, and social categories of governance and systems of dispossession and exploitation.",

      "descriptionSearch": "In modern parlance and scholarship, blackness is understood not as a biological but rather a socially constructed phenomenon. This course extends common perceptions by working from the foundational concept that blackness is not only social construction but also performance and lived experience. Using the lens of performance on racial identity foregrounds the active and shifting nature of race in contrast to the potentially passive, static connotation of construction. But what is this term performance that is now so widely used as to be an anathema? In this course, we explore performance broadly as entertainment, representation, social function, and lived experience. By the end of the course, students will analyze multiple performance types from theatrical and dance performance to performance of race in everyday life. They will also study and practice at least four core black performance studies methodologies: oral interpretation of literature, ethnography, written performance analysis, and embodied performance (i.e. movement, music and/or theatre). In this way, students will begin to understand performance as both subject matter and method. The course will be structured around discussions, written responses, and performance exercises that help students analyze and practice each methodology. At the end of the semester, students will create final creative research projects that articulate key theories of black performance studies and draw on at least one of the featured performance methodologies. While preference is given to Africana Studies concentrators, students are not required to have prior performance experience.",

Knowledge of the Indigenous is a foundational element of the United States. From missionaries documenting Indigenous languages, to sports mascots, DNA testing, and even to New Age spirit quests and sweat lodges, the coherence and legitimacy of this settler colonial empire has demanded expertise in and the appropriation of Indigenous bodies, knowledges, and cultures as a means of continually displacing and erasing them. And yet, that is not the only way to produce knowledge of, by, and with Indigenous people. Indigenous Studies provides a variant way of thinking and learning about indigeneity. The imperative of Indigenous Studies is to understand Indigenous peoples on their own terms and the world on those same terms.

This course seeks to introduce students to the concept of \"racial capitalism\"--which rejects treatments of race (and racism) as external to the so-called real workings of capitalism--as a way to understand this relationship and as an activist hermeneutic through which to identify and respond to the conditions that American Studies must reckon with. Students will gain familiarity with the global history of racial capitalism and the power of the concept itself through secondary sources and a wide range of primary sources, and through engaged discussion and short essays. Throughout the course, we will pay special attention to the cultural politics, political geographies, and historical development of racial capitalism, thus attending to how the social relations of racial capitalism have been known, lived, and resisted across time and space. The course is organized around three key themes: the land question; race, capitalism, and nation; and the banalities of racial capitalism. Across these themes, the course will address such issues and topics as North American settler colonialism, circum-Caribbean plantation slave and \"Coolie\" labor, mass incarceration, the subprime mortgage crisis, and the War on Terror. The course will do so through and against a history of racial capitalism that privileges the U.S. nation-state in particular. By the end of this course, students should be able to: detail and analyze the historical development of and resistance to racial capitalism, doing so in relation to the global itineraries of racial slavery, settler colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy; trace the history of the concept of racial capitalism itself; and identify how the concept continues to shape the field of American Studies.",

The body as a tool for expression, social critique and resistance evolved radically, as the work of modern dance artists in the U.S. exposed and dismantled restrictive aspects of the racial and social dynamics of the 20th century, especially for women and people of color. We will examine particular artists' voices that arose with new aesthetic and thematic concerns in the struggle for artistic freedom and social justice, while examining why some, and not others, had opportunities to advance their art.\n\nWe will investigate key artists and works in the historic canon in order to understand the ways in which bodies rebel, overtly and covertly, to guide us in the power and importance of embodied resistance. Virtual class visits with artists active in the reconstruction and performance of works of protest such as Talley Beatty's \u003cI\u003eMourne's Bench\u003c/I\u003e, Jane Dudley's \u003cI\u003eTime is Money\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eHarmonica Breakdown\u003c/I\u003e, Martha Graham's \u003cI\u003eChronicle\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eDeep Song\u003c/I\u003e, Pearl Primus' \u003cI\u003eStrange Fruit\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eHard Time Blues\u003c/I\u003e, Sophie Maslow's \u003cI\u003eDustbowl Ballads\u003c/I\u003e, and Anna Sokolow's \u003cI\u003eSlaughter of the Innocents\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eRooms\u003c/I\u003e will enhance our dialogue. We will also connect these historic pieces to the work of current artists such as Dr. Shamell Bell and Akram Khan.\n\nWe will learn to \"read\" dance as a language and to develop a critical framework by examining, for example, how we define bodily innovation, what a work reflects about its time, its creator, and the place of dance in society, how the body is constructed/deconstructed in the work, spiritual practice in relation to dance-making, the social identity of the creator and the performers, and the role of music/sound/text in relation to movement expression. We will periodically practice movement ideas in workshops designed for any student; no previous dance experience is expected or required.\n\nThe class will collaboratively develop final project(s) on our chosen themes, using movement, sound, and research to develop our own call(s) to action.

Buddhist ideas and practices now seem ubiquitous, available even in the form of smartphone apps like Headspace and Ten Percent Happier. In this class, we'll explore how Buddhism came to be the profoundly important cultural force in American life that it is today. We'll read a variety of Buddhist-influenced literary texts, from the Beat poetry of the 1950s to contemporary novels like Ruth Ozeki's \u003cI\u003eA Tale for the Time Being\u003c/I\u003e. And we'll range far beyond the world of literature into other cultural domains in which Buddhism has had a deep impact, like environmentalism, psychotherapy, and Western attitudes towards death and dying. We'll also give special attention to the role that Buddhism is playing in the struggle for racial justice (from bell hooks to Black Lives Matter). And we'll engage in an experiential investigation of the benefits of incorporating contemplative practices like mindfulness into higher education: students will learn a variety of meditation techniques, and we'll spend time each week practicing and reflecting upon those practices. Students will be expected to maintain a daily meditation practice outside of class (10-15 minutes a day), with the help of one of those newfangled meditation apps no less! No prior experience with meditation is necessary. Just an open mind. (For detailed information about the format of this hybrid course, please visit: www.tinyurl.com/Engl239)",

Are you curious why black-eyed peas and collards are considered \"soul food\"? In this course, we will answer these questions by digging in to the histories of global environmental transformation through colonialism, slavery, and international migration. We will consider the production and consumption of food as a locus of power over the last 300 years. Beginning with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade and continuing through the 20th century, we trace the global movement of plants, foods, flavors, workers, businesses, and agricultural knowledge. Major units include rice production by enslaved people in the Americas; Asian American food histories during the Cold War; and fat studies critiques of obesity discourse. We will discuss food justice, food sovereignty, and contemporary movements for food sustainability in the context of these histories and our contemporary world. Readings are interdisciplinary, but our emphasis will be on historical analyses of race, labor, environment, health, and gender.",

It also introduces foundational methodologies in Native American and Indigenous Studies and strategies for pursuing decolonizing scholarship and action. Beginning with the diverse Indigenous societies that inhabited the Americas millennia before Columbus's arrival, it discusses the cultural complexity of Native peoples, nations, and worldviews rooted in particular ecosystems and homelands, as well as accounts of beginnings and migrations. It addresses how Native peoples confronted grievous epidemics resulting from the \"Columbian Exchange,\" and contended with Euro-colonial projects of \"discovery\" and colonization. Indigenous nations' multifaceted efforts to maintain sovereignty and lands through eras of pervasive violence and removal are discussed, as well as the important yet under-recognized ways that Native communities negotiated the tumultuous era and conflicting allegiances of the Civil War. The course centers on Indigenous actors-intellectuals, diplomats, legal strategists, knowledge keepers, spiritual leaders, artists, and others-and consistently connects historical events with present-day debates over land, historical memory, education, and activism. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to engage with original materials pertaining to Native histories in the Williams College Archives/Special Collections and Art Museum. While the scope of the course is continental and transoceanic, it devotes significant attention to the Native Northeast and the particular Indigenous homelands in which Williams College is located.",

This course maps out some of the intellectual and political interventions of Indigenous feminists in analyzing and struggling against genocide, heteropatriarchy, conquest and racial capitalism in settler states like the US and Canada. This course will focus on how Indigenous women, Two Spirit and trans people have analyzed and struggled against the imposition of colonial constructs of gender and sexuality that mark Indigenous lives and lands as sites of extraction. It will examine how carceral regimes of control produced by the intertwined histories of conquest and Transatlantic slavery have been imposed upon Indigenous lives through the child protection system and the prison industrial complex. Students will be invited to consider how Indigenous feminist practices 'make a future' (Brant 1981) against and beyond the settler state. This course aims to familiarize students with historical and contemporary Indigenous feminist works, as well as provide an overview of Indigenous feminist political formations, poetry, fiction, and making practices.

American drama abounds with hidden knowledge and false representations. (This is not surprising: theatre is always on some level a deceptive practice, a place where one person pretends to be another, and where what is spoken is always open to skeptical scrutiny. We might say theatre is always lying as much as lying is always theatre.) This tutorial course will examine what lies hidden in American plays from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Beginning with excerpted critical and historical writings on secrecy and lying (\u003cI\u003eThe Adventures of Pinocchio\u003c/I\u003e, Machiavelli's \u003cI\u003eThe Prince\u003c/I\u003e, Thomas Carlson's \u003cI\u003eLying and Deception: Theory and Practice\u003c/I\u003e, among others), we will proceed to a set of American plays from across a wide spectrum of playwrights, including Eugene O'Neill, Edward Albee, Sarah Ruhl, Arthur Miller, Amy Herzog, Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, Annie Baker, and others.  Student papers will explore how hidden knowledge structures dramatic action, how different characters create and respond to untruths, and what can we learn in particular from \u003cI\u003eAmerican\u003c/I\u003e drama about a national relationship to honesty and its opposites. For Fall 2020, the tutorial will be conducted primarily online. Depending on enrollments, we may divide into groups with three students, instead of the traditional two-student tutorial format.",

This year, the foci will be issues currently at the forefront of the field: planning for public health and pandemics, racist planning legacies and anti-racist approaches, poverty and affordable housing, climate resilience planning, alternative transportation and transit, and agriculture and food systems. The class is organized into two parts. Part 1 involves reading and discussion of the planning literature: history, theory, policy, ethics, legal framework, and case studies. Labs include GIS mapping, hands-on planning exercises and project development. Part 2 involves project work: tackling an current planning problem in your home community. The includes primary research, conducting interviews with policymakers, stakeholders and residents, site visits, attending meetings, and other activities as demanded by the particular project. The project work draws on students' academic training and extracurricular activities, and applies creative solutions to thorny problems. Labs will be small group work and project work. The course includes several class presentations; students will gain skills in interacting with public officials, interviewing, preparing presentations, public speaking, report-writing, and teamwork.

This course challenges what we dominantly understand as activism---key to the emergence of ethnic studies and feminist and queer theory. Moving away from political actions centered in these fields, such as strikes, protests, and boycotts, this course will turn to visual and performance art works by artists of color, who consider other forms of action that are not overtly visible, resistant, oppositional, agentive, militant, loud, liberatory, and documentable. Each week, we will examine a performance at the limit of action, including silence, sexual abjection, concealment, melancholia, and waiting, alongside issues related to race, gender, sexuality, labor, and migration among others. How might we approach and reconcile with performances that once again reify notions of racialized and gendered bodies as apolitical, passive, submissive, and compliant? Drawing on scholarship within black and women of color feminist criticism, queer of color critique, critical ethnic studies, and performance studies, this course will attune students to the role of aesthetics to interrogate and expand what we typically conceive of as activism, resistance, power, and survival from racialized, feminized, and queer positions.",

Each unit, we will study key scholarship that centers reproduction, slavery, care and domestic work, indentured servitude, sex work, and low wage flexible labor, to name a few, alongside queer and feminist modes of performance that respond to and/or provide strategies to live and survive under racial capitalism. We will discuss seminal works by theorists, including Karl Marx, Luce Irigaray, Cedric Robinson, Jennifer Morgan, Hortense Spillers, Lisa Lowe, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Dorothy Roberts, Angela Davis, José Esteban Muñoz, and Leo Bersani, in tandem with performances, such as paintings, performance art, poetry, protests, photography, prints, music, and sculptures. This course will equip students with a critical understanding of the ways racial capitalism has centrally relied upon the mass capture and recruitment of racialized and gendered labor in and beyond the U.S. and how, through performance, life under these conditions have been reimagined.",

Many, however, are unaware of the decades-long cinematic movement to which Dash belongs. In this course, we will devote our critical inquiry to the creative output of the L.A. Rebellion, a group of Black cinematic artists trained at the UCLA Film and Television School between the 1960s and 1990s. Our visual journey will take us through a diverse set of filmmakers like Charles Burnett, Ben Caldwell, Barbara McCullough, Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Haile Gerima, Alile Sharon Larkin, Billy Woodberry, among many, many others, and how they sought to not only redefine the Black image on-screen but also reimagine the infinite possibilities of Blackness. We will pay close attention to the heterogeneity of genres, styles, and techniques that they put into practice from narrative to neorealism to documentary to avant-garde/experimental to African and African American musical and storytelling traditions. We will explore the various social and political issues that were represented by their films including: racial and class oppression, Black feminisms, Black Power, Afrocentrism, anti-colonialism and decolonization, police brutality and mass incarceration, radical social movements and coalition building, and the importance of community-based art and film practices. Finally, we will touch upon some of the recent works that have been inspired by the L.A. Rebellion, including the aforementioned \u003cI\u003eLemonade\u003c/I\u003e and Barry Jenkins' \u003cI\u003eMoonlight\u003c/I\u003e (2016).

On the other, it demands that we interrogate our own intellectual and cultural traditions and trauma. Critical Indigenous theory is a tool in those projects, as it offers a corrective and an opening up of both dominant critical theory traditions that violently erase Indigenous bodies and political realities and of Indigenous theory that can essentialize difference and replicate oppressive dynamics in our communities. Critical Indigenous theory seeks to understand the structures and relations of power in settler colonialism, nested sovereignty, and culturally specific Indigenous philosophical traditions, like Indigenous studies more broadly, but also questions the key concepts that define Indigenous studies: tradition, sovereignty, authenticity, identity, race, gender, and sexuality. In this course, we will read major works in critical Indigenous theory that address indigeneity as it relates to race, postcolonial theory, feminist and two-spirit critique, alternative political engagement with the settler colonial state, and questions of \"colonial unknowing.\" We will work on cultivating the reading practices needed to parse dense theoretical texts, and over the course of the semester you will develop a research project on a topic of your choosing that will allow you to take critical Indigenous theories and employ them as analytic tools and lenses.",

Anchored in the contexts of U.S. colonialisms, racialization, and accumulation, this course aims to expose students to the cultural politics of \"nature\" as a way of \"doing\" American Studies. Specifically, this course investigates formations of and struggles against U.S. colonialisms, racialization, and accumulation via the many symbolic and material iterations, negotiations, and contestations of the contingent relations between and among human and non-human natures. Organized around a significant research paper and weekly written responses, this course ultimately aims to foster students' critical writing, reading, analytical thinking, and comparative inquiry skills across such contexts and sites of contestation, and across texts of different genres and media. We will work with a wide range of primary sources, including published fiction and poetry, legal documents, newspaper articles, speeches, recorded songs, and films, photos, paintings and other visual culture. By the end of this course, students should be able to describe the historical foundations of dominant ideas, attitudes, and practices toward non-human natures, as well as analyze how ideas of \"nature\" mediate the ways in which colonial, racial, gender, and sexual categories and structures inform and are (re)produced by U.S. institutions and in public areas such as the law, public policy, and property. Finally, students should be able to interpret how racialized and colonized peoples' visions, representations, and practices of liberation with regard to relations with non-human natures and the materiality of land precede, contend with, and exceed normative political, economic, and social categories of governance and systems of dispossession and exploitation.",

In this seminar, we will pursue research projects directly related to the art exhibitions we study, and examine southern California conceptualism, photography, performance, painting, sculpture (including assemblage and installation), and video by artists both canonical and lesser known.  Student projects will analyze the critical responses to the exhibitions, while also exploring the roles of archives, art criticism, and curatorial practice in contemporary art history.",

      "descriptionSearch": "The suburbs transformed the United States. At the broadest level, they profoundly altered spatial residential geography (especially in terms of race), consumer expectations and behavior, governmental policies, cultural norms and assumptions, societal connections, and Americans' relationship to nature. More specifically, the different waves of post-World War II suburban development have both reflected large-scale shifts in how power and money have operated in the American political economy; and set in motion deep-seated changes in electoral politics, in Americans' understandings of how their income should be used, and in how the built landscape should be re-imagined. This tutorial will explore the rich historical literature that has emerged over the last twenty years to provide students with a history of the suburbs, to see the suburbs as more than simply collections of houses that drew individual homeowners who wanted to leave urban areas.  We will focus most of our attention on the period from 1945 through the 1980s.  Some of the questions we will consider will include:  how did the first wave of suburban development bring together postwar racial and Cold War ideologies? Is it possible, as one historian has argued, that suburbs actually created the environmental movement of the 1960s? And how have historians understood the role that suburbs played in America's conservative political turn, leading to the election of Ronald Reagan?",

This course is an introduction to cultural anthropology (also known as social or socio-cultural anthropology), the study of human society in all its profound variety.  Through deep, sustained, systematic participation in and observation of a particular social context, anthropologists seek to comprehend and illuminate the human condition. Anthropologists' insights into the ways in which human institutions-language, economy, religion, social stratification, law, sexuality, art, the state, and many more-are culturally constructed and reproduced have transformed the way the world is understood.  Puncturing ethnocentrism, anthropology's attentiveness to the ideas and practices of cultures in every part of the globe vastly enriches the archive of human answers to human problems. The distinctive methods of the discipline enable anthropologists to discover patterns and phenomena not discernible in other modes of enquiry. With such findings anthropologists are able to make critical interventions in public discourse and to demonstrate how deeply we are all shaped by cultural forces.",

Or from another angle, how does sexuality infuse spectacle? This tutorial introduces students to theories of spectacle ranging from the ancient Greeks to Marxist-inspired thinkers in the 20th century. In particular, we will examine how feminist thinkers have contributed to this literature and how theories of spectacle relate to questions of gender and sexuality.

Among the questions that we will consider are the following: What is the relationship between written texts and images? What is it that documentary films \"document?\" What is the relationship between images and stories, and should the techniques used in fiction films to construct voice, point of view, identification, narrative sequence, etc. apply as well in the creation of nonfiction films? What is the role of film in anthropology, and how does ethnographic filmmaking relate to anthropology and to the broader documentary film tradition?

We consider how mindfulness relates to Buddhist discourses and practices, and to the rapid rise of fields like contemplative neuroscience, affective neuroscience, and integrative neurobiology. How and why has the research on mindfulness and other applied meditative practices exploded since 2000? How has this research helped us understand and explain the intersection of mind, emotion, behavior, and human development? We critically examine the models of the mind developed by clinical and evolutionary psychologists and researchers in fields such as affective neuroscience to better understand the applications of mindfulness in the US today. Specifically, we consider how mindfulness and other forms of meditation are being used to improve the training of health care providers and educators, while augmenting and deepening the quality of their engagement with patients, students, and others they serve. We examine and train in a variety of meditation practices including mindfulness and forest bathing, while unpacking the subjective experience of our minds and emotions first-hand. Students will be asked to engage in mindfulness practices the entire semester.",

We will be particularly attuned to the ways in which these categories are performed through and maintained by rituals and how bodies are deployed in ritual spaces as instruments of persuasion and control. We will also look in depth at a variety of ritual forms, including scapegoating and sacrifice, and how they serve as engines of political control and protest, and we will examine the uses of dead bodies and memorials as vehicles for gaining and maintaining political power and the destruction and desecration of bodies and memorials as a form of political protest and dissent.

What are the local and global economies of waste in which we are all embedded and how are they structured by class, race, caste, gender and nation? In this seminar we critically examine the production of waste - both as material and as category - and its role in the production of value, meaning, hierarchy and the environment. Readings include ethnographic accounts of sanitation labor and social hierarchy; studies of the political and environmental consequences of systems of waste management in the colonial period and the present; and theoretical inquiries into the relation between filth and culture, including work by Mary Douglas, Dipesh Chakrabarty and Karl Marx. Geographically the foci are South Asia, Japan, and the United States. There is also a fieldwork component to the course. In (safe, socially distant) fieldtrips we follow the waste streams flowing out of Williams - to an incinerator, a sewage treatment plant, recycling and composting facilities and other sites - and students individually explore the everyday social life of waste in our communities.",

We situate our campus health projects within the wider context of how power and intersectionality inflect and structure health and well-being locally and globally. Our case studies explore how structural racism shapes medical education, pediatric care, and maternity care in the US, how the spread of US psychiatry inflects the landscape of global mental health, and how queer activism responded to the HIV/AIDS crisis. We consider how disruptive moments like COVID-19 or HIV/AIDS can serve as focal moments in social history that reveal underlying inequalities of health outcomes and access. We attend to the parallel roles of narrative in medicine and ethnography, as we contrast the discourse of providers \u0026 patients as well as researchers \u0026 interlocutors. Throughout our goal is to better understand the strengths and limits of ethnographic inquiry while exploring the challenges of collaborative and participatory research within communities always already structured by power, privilege, and engaged practices.",

The majority of these images have proven to be fake, however their popularity was witness to people's hope that we can \"reset\" the environment and a yearning to reframe animals' positionality vis-à-vis their habitats and humans. Using critical lenses from ecocriticism and animal studies, we will be exploring texts from non-Western traditions in which animals figure strongly from pre-modern times to the age of the Anthropocene. The focus will be on Arabic, Persian and Turkish texts all in translation. The course will be traversing several genres and texts from Pre-Islamic poetry, the Quran, the 10th century Ikhwan as-Safa's epistle \u003cI\u003eThe Case of Animals versus Man Before the King of the Jinn\u003c/I\u003e, the fables of \u003cI\u003eKalila and Dimna\u003c/I\u003e, Farid ed-Din 'Attar's \u003cI\u003eConference of Birds\u003c/I\u003e, travelogues, paintings, contemporary film till we reach recent fiction with cyborgs and drones. Throughout the course, we will be examining themes such as diverse conceptualizations of what it means to be an \"animal\", what constitutes' animal agency and animal subjectivity irrespective of humans and their often utilitarian lens. We will do this by investigating how animals through these texts have been represented, imagined and reconfigured whether allegorically or otherwise as communities and in relation to humans and the environment and the implications of that. Finally, we will explore what a poetics of animal studies in these cultural and literary traditions could look like. The course will consist of multiple forms of evaluation like participation, Glow posts, essays, experiential reflections and creative tasks.",

However, the creation of the Alliance Israelite Universelle's schools (1830s), the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the decolonization process in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War accelerated the departure of Arab and Berber Jews from their homelands to other destinations, including France, Israel, Canada, the United States, and different Latin American countries. Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly. The course will help students understand the depth of Jewish life in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and interrogate the local and global factors that led to their disappearance from both social and cultural memories for a long time. Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world. Resisting both conflict and nostalgia as the primary determinants of Jewish-Muslim relations, the course will help students think about multiple ways in which Jews and Muslims formed communities of citizens despite their differences and disagreements.",

Even today, one hears phrases, such as \"emigrate in order to become healthier,\" which point to the fact that travel had been and remains a defining element of Arab-Islamic culture. This course will draw on poems, dictionary entries, short stories, novels, films, and memoirs to expose students to the ways Arab travelers--ancient and contemporary--understood the world through their experience-based or fictionalized travel accounts. Reading travel writings about West Asia, Turkey, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, students will have a complicated understanding not only of the Arabic-speaking world, but also of the forces that shaped travelers' representations of other people and their cultures.

In such narratives, the selective utilization of archaeology and ancient history often serves important functions in articulating a conscious and deliberate national history. Thus, in nationalist renderings, archaeological sites and artifacts are not merely relics of the past; they can also be potent and conspicuous symbols of national identity for the modern nation-state. In the Middle East, with its rich archaeological heritage, the relationship among politics, nationalism, and archeology has been particularly strong and interesting. This tutorial addresses the powerful nexus between history and nationalism with a special emphasis on the Middle East. It will explore the battle over who controls history and the \"stuff\" of history such as antiquities, land, heritage sites, and museum exhibitions and how that control has expressed itself in several Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, and Iran. Furthermore, it will discuss how archaeology entered the political discourse, the ethics of repatriation and appropriation, and archaeology's role in contested terrains and political disputes.",

Through four thematic units (memorialization, religion, nature, and identity), we look at artworks in their original contexts and consider how cross-cultural exchanges stimulated new interpretations across time and space. We examine a broad range of objects including ritual bronze vessels, Buddhist temples, landscape paintings, woodblock prints, and installations. We also discuss these artworks in relation to other forms of creative expression such as ritual practice, performance, and literature. How is East Asia defined geographically and culturally? How did the exchange in ideas, trade, and travel impact the formation of East Asian art? How do artworks and artifacts help us understand East Asia's past? These fundamental questions guide our discussion. Through this course, students learn to think critically about shared and diverse human experiences across cultures and historical periods. Students also reflect on historiographical issues surrounding East Asian art and analyze why certain types of artworks were historically underrepresented in museum spaces and academic scholarship. To contribute to public knowledge, students will also develop and edit a Wikipedia page on an artwork or artist of their choice. Visits to the Williams College Museum of Art and Special Collections also form an integral part of the course.",

The course will enable students interested in dance, theatrical and visual arts (including advertising and marketing) to hone their skills in the practice of analyzing still and moving images, while also offering students of history and art history the opportunity to develop competency in historical research. This is primarily a discussion-based seminar course.

From colonial-era propaganda newsreels about Africa's 'fighting men' to contemporary white-savior narratives that exploit current socio-political ruptures on the continent for epic effect, films about Africa produced by a primarily Western cinematic regime have proven themselves to be highly effective apparatuses for framing \"Africa\" as a concept to be summoned time and time again to tell different stories for different audiences, and in doing so privilege particular viewpoints and imaginaries. This tutorial will provide a space for robust discussion and debate about the various representative tropes, conceptualizations, and visualizations that have been used to shape the contours of \"Africa\" as understood by a primarily Western audience from past to present, and how these same tropes in many ways have come to define the nature of the relationship between film / cinema and the continent over the history of their engagement. In doing so, it will also address how strategic displays and narratives deployed by cinematic productions often support specific power dynamics that locate an idea of \"Africa\" within paradigms of specific cultural and political understanding. In zeroing in on how such films promote targeted realities for people and places within the continent, this tutorial will address how \"Africa\" in Western film and cinematic traditions is positioned within a particular framework of understanding that is more often than not irrevocably tethered to a Western imaginary.",

      "descriptionSearch": "In 1874, an art critic mockingly termed Claude Monet's painting of a sunrise over the sea \"impressionist [...] more unfinished than wallpaper in an embryonic state.\" With this phrase, he gave a name to a new style of painting that profoundly shaped the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century avant-garde movements in Europe and beyond. Beginning with the invention of photography in the early nineteenth century and ending with the advent of cinema, abstraction, and mechanized warfare in the first decades of the twentieth, this course will trace the origins and afterlives of \"Impressionism\" in art and cultural history. Many of the artists who continue to draw the largest crowds in museums around the world today--among them Manet and Monet, Degas and Seurat, Van Gogh and Rodin, Klimt and Picasso--fall within our period of study and will be subjects of our examination. Designed for students who have no prior experience studying art history, the course will prioritize methods of close looking and formal analysis. (If social distancing protocols allow, the course will include optional study visits to examine first-hand examples of paintings, sculptures, decorative arts, and printmaking at the Clark Art Institute and Manton Study Center for Works on Paper and Williams College Museum of Art). At the same time, the questions and methods at the core of our inquiry will be fundamentally interdisciplinary, and will engage students all across the humanities and sciences (major scientific figures such as the inventor Thomas Edison and the evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin will figure prominently in our narrative). Readings will emphasize close engagement with primary sources drawn from multiple disciplines: writings by artists and art critics from the period, as well as scientists, philosophers, psychologists, political theorists, and poets. We will approach \"Impressionism\" and \"Post-Impressionism\" as episodes in the cultural history of Europe that are uniquely revealing of a historical experience we still acutely feel today, which was called, for the first time in the nineteenth-century, \"modernity.\"",

However, how we make meaning of it depends on so many variables--who we are, where we are, and what we view and value. It also depends on what tools we bring to bear, especially in such challenging times! A critical question is how \"art\" figures and what agency it wields among people. By extension, what role do museums play in the education of individuals and the formation of communities? This class is an opportunity to explore these issues with particular reference to our own institution (Williams College Museum of Art or WCMA) and the objects enshrined therein. We will consider how the collection has grown and changed over time, and compare that trajectory with those of other museums to broaden our inquiry. How, for example, are local and/or globalizing agendas manifest in exhibitions and acquisitions? And how does the heritage industry factor in transnational museum culture? Along the way, we will consider diverse materials--from oil painting to wooden sculpture, numismatics to manuscripts, photography to performance---and how different cultures might be presented, distorted and even erased in gallery installations and public spaces. A primary focus will be the role of curators---what do they do and how does their work help to shape the world we occupy? This will be a hands-on class beginning with the following question: What have YOU curated lately?",

With patrons ranging from powerful monarchs and monks to merchants and tradespeople, Buddhist art has historically reflected the religion's social inclusivity. This course will survey the architecture, painting and material culture of Buddhism in Asia, tracing its influence in diverse media, from rock-cut architecture to Zen painting. A close reading of primary texts, such as architectural inscriptions in India, manuscripts from Tibet, and travelogues of Chinese pilgrims, will provide greater context for the artworks.",

As a great cultural highway, the Silk Road stimulated the movement of peoples, the trade of luxury goods, and the transmission of technologies, ideas, and artistic motifs. This seminar examines the materials and material things traveling along the Silk Road from the fall of the Han Dynasty to the rise of the Mongol Empire (ca. 300 too 1400 CE). We focus, in particular, on the movement and use of three key materials: silk, glass, and paper.\n\nTopics include the transmission of silk-weaving technologies between China and Central Asia, glass bead production on the Korean peninsula, and the role of Japan's Shosoin Treasury in the construction of kingship. The emphasis will be on the material culture and sites from China, Korea, and Japan, with forays to India, Afghanistan, Turkey, and beyond. Students learn to critically analyze issues related to cultural interactions and gain familiarity with critical approaches to materiality and material culture studies. As a class, we will also develop a collaborative map as a resource to remember historical developments as well as key dates, objects, materials, and individuals in this course. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, the collaborative mapping project, and a final paper. No prior knowledge of Asian art history is required or assumed.",

Over the course of the class, students will explore different conceptualizations of sustainability and how these conceptualizations take form in built environments in response to the cultural identities, political agendas, social norms, gender roles, and religious values circulating in society at any given moment. In recognizing the relationship between the way things are constructed (technique of assembly, technology, materials, process) and the deeper meanings behind the structural languages deployed, students will come to understand sustainability as a fundamentally context-specific ideal, and its manifestation within the architectural environment as a mode of producing dialogues about the anticipated futures of both cultural and architectural worlds.",

And yet, the plague years also spawned a remarkable amount of creative and activist image-making aimed at fighting, mourning, and grappling with AIDS. Now, we find ourselves in another pivotal moment: while the past decade has provoked a new wave of AIDS historiography, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused AIDS to reverberate with even greater force. Together, we will ask difficult and probing questions about this phenomenon called the 'AIDS epidemic,' examining the role of art in frontline activism, the ethics of AIDS historiography, mainstream visions of the AIDS body, and the need for a diversity of AIDS narratives. This seminar-style course will combine weekly screenings with readings, short writing assignments, student-led discussion, and a final research project of the student's design.

In its media, its subject matter, regional variation, range of patronage, and artistic virtuosity, it displays startling diversity. From the northern Himalayan hills to Mysore in the south, artists, often working in family workshops for royalty, priests and wealthy merchants, have adorned caves and temples, illustrated books, and created lavish albums with themes ranging from the sacred to the secular. The study of Indian painting itself is a vast, evolving body of literature that continues to oscillate between discussions of artistic style and a concentration on content and context.\n\nThe aim of this seminar is twofold: to outline the development of Indian painting historically; and to understand the political, social and religious circumstances that produced some of the greatest masterworks in Indian art. How was Indian painting used? Who were the patrons? How does the art form reflect the particular cultural values of its time? As an analytic framework, the seminar will consider Indian miniature painting both in light of primary literary sources as well as through current scholarship.",

We will focus on a series of recent exhibitions organized as part of a Getty initiative entitled Pacific Standard Time. Diverse in scope, these shows explored important developments in postwar art in California, including feminist art, African American assemblage, Chicano collectives, Modernist architecture, craft, and queer activism.  In this seminar, we will pursue research projects directly related to the art exhibitions we study, and examine southern California conceptualism, photography, performance, painting, sculpture (including assemblage and installation), and video by artists both canonical and lesser known.  Student projects will analyze the critical responses to the exhibitions, while also exploring the roles of archives, art criticism, and curatorial practice in contemporary art history.",

Students will work with a wide variety of materials and will gain facility in media such as charcoal, graphite, collage, watercolor and ink.\n\nAs the term progresses, assignments and exercises will become more complex and students will explore more conceptual ideas in drawing related to material specificity, research, experimentation, and working from the imagination. The class will conclude with a publication of a zine. The theme or topic of the publication will be determined by the dynamic of the class and the students' curiosities and concerns. Through lectures, assigned readings, screenings, and visits to the WCMA, this course hopes to expand what it means to draw and to become aware of how drawing appears in the practices of other artists as well the world outside of art contexts.",

ARTS 115 will offer instruction in how form and meaning can be created through the use of objects. Similar to poetry, where a particular word carries a specific history, meaning, and power, objects also contain complex associations. Through the process of alteration, transformation, and manipulation, sculpture reveals the narrative power of form and materials. This course will provide a historical framework for how sculpture- particularly contemporary works- have expressed ideas, while also providing instruction on techniques and methods used to build, dismantle, rearrange, combine and create art with objects as the inspiration. The ultimate goal will be to develop your individual voice and imagination, become familiar with processes and techniques, and to become fluent in generating meaning that is important to you. We will be integrating the study of a variety of artists whose work utilizes objects in their sculpture such as the work of: Jean Shin, Marcel Broodthaers, Dario Robletto, Doris Salcedo, Robert Gober, among others. This class is designed to be hybrid, with a combination of in-person and remote components.

The course will include introductions to various methods in lino printing including stencilling, collaging, reduction printing, while also familiarising students with the fundamentals of printmaking inks and papers--how to use them, choose them, modify them.\n\nThe first 2-3 weeks of class will be held in person, outdoors, where students will practice tool handling and carving techniques (also available via video to remote students). Thereafter we will be entirely remote, exploring ways of making improvisational prints at home, using rubbings/frottage, DIY presses, and making connections with local print shops to print the completed blocks. We will also experiment with homemade inks. If deemed safe, private printing sessions can be arranged for on campus students a few times in the semester.\n\nLectures will consider the history of the block print, its present day interdisciplinary potential, and virtual visits with contemporary practitioners.

The class will spend two weeks on each artist, analyzing and copying a work in the first week and producing a visual response in the second. Students will meet twice a week online, once as a class for technical demonstration and slide presentations and again in small groups of 3 or 4 for reading discussion and critique. Some demonstrations and supporting materials will be available asynchronously. The goals of the class are to introduce students to basic painting skills like color mixing, brushwork, composition, and palette management, as well as concepts like color theory, modernism and self-expression in a cultural context. So that students may work in a domestic setting, the size of the assignments are modest and the materials like water-based acrylics, crayons, and paper are manageable.

We examine a broad range of objects including ritual bronze vessels, Buddhist temples, landscape paintings, woodblock prints, and installations. We also discuss these artworks in relation to other forms of creative expression such as ritual practice, performance, and literature. How is East Asia defined geographically and culturally? How did the exchange in ideas, trade, and travel impact the formation of East Asian art? How do artworks and artifacts help us understand East Asia's past? These fundamental questions guide our discussion. Through this course, students learn to think critically about shared and diverse human experiences across cultures and historical periods. Students also reflect on historiographical issues surrounding East Asian art and analyze why certain types of artworks were historically underrepresented in museum spaces and academic scholarship. To contribute to public knowledge, students will also develop and edit a Wikipedia page on an artwork or artist of their choice.

This course investigates Japanese culture and compares it with our own, by examining Japanese literature about two universal human experiences--love and death--and asking how Japanese writers inflect these ideas in their work. The course begins with tales of doomed lovers that were popular in the eighteenth-century kabuki and puppet theaters, and that still feature prominently in Japanese popular culture today. From there we move on to a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and sacrifice, martyrdom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at an advanced age. We will focus on novels and short stories by canonical modern authors like Tanizaki, Kawabata, and Mishima, as well as contemporary popular fiction by writers like Murakami Haruki and Murakami Ryu. We will also give significant attention to popular visual culture, including puppet theater, comics, animation, and film. \u003cI\u003eThe class and the readings are in English.\u003c/I\u003e",

How and why has the research on mindfulness and other applied meditative practices exploded since 2000? How has this research helped us understand and explain the intersection of mind, emotion, behavior, and human development? We critically examine the models of the mind developed by clinical and evolutionary psychologists and researchers in fields such as affective neuroscience to better understand the applications of mindfulness in the US today. Specifically, we consider how mindfulness and other forms of meditation are being used to improve the training of health care providers and educators, while augmenting and deepening the quality of their engagement with patients, students, and others they serve. We examine and train in a variety of meditation practices including mindfulness and forest bathing, while unpacking the subjective experience of our minds and emotions first-hand.

      "descriptionSearch": "You've heard of the \"material girl\" (or boy), but what about the material Buddhist? This course encourages students to look beyond modernist ideals of Buddhism as a rational tradition of monks, monasteries and manuscripts, merely advocating mindfulness. In this course, we take Buddhist \"stuff\" (material culture) seriously. We explore what exactly is material culture, and what makes it Buddhist? If Buddhism is supposed to be a tradition that encourages non-attachment, then what is meant by \"Buddhist material culture\"? Shouldn't Buddhists be free of material things? Or, rather, who says they have to be? This course offers: (1) an introduction to the core concepts of Buddhism; (2) a brief overview of Material Religion, or the \"material turn\" in the study of religion; and (3) a preliminary exploration into the vast material- and spiritual worlds of Buddhist Asia, particularly China, Japan, Myanmar, Tibet, and Thailand. We begin by decolonializing Buddhism (think \u003cI\u003emandala\u003c/I\u003e, not only meditation; or ghosts and spirits, not just \u003cI\u003esutra\u003c/I\u003e). Next, we trace religious studies trends that privilege material investigations that acknowledge the agency of not only humans but also the agency of objects/things/stuff, and that emphasizes the dynamics among people, things, and spirits. We learn about these dynamics by looking closely at Buddhist stuff. Things act upon us, and we (re)act upon them. They shape identity, create meaning, and maintain relationships. We will learn that things are never just things. They help us better understand what people do in Buddhism, not just what people believe. This course includes brief experiential components on Buddhist meditation and ritual. No prior experience in meditation or Buddhism is required. This course does not assume any previous background in Buddhism, Religion, Asian Studies, or Art History.",

Gandhi is well known today for his philosophy of non-violent resistance and its application in India's freedom struggle as well as his influence on the work of leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. Hailed as the 'father of the Indian nation', however, Gandhi is not only known for his political ideas but also for his deep engagement with aspect of everyday human behavior and morality: truth, vegetarianism, sex and celibacy, to name just a few of his obsessions which contributed to making his broader philosophy. It is this commitment to a morally pure life that earned him the title of 'Mahatma' or Great Soul in India. This tutorial will focus on three key aspects of Gandhi: his ideas of peaceful protest as means of social and political change, his contemplations on moral philosophy, and on his legacy in modern India and the world. Students will read a combination of Gandhi's own writings as well as journal articles, monographs and films. The course will probe questions such as: What was the context and nature of Gandhian nationalism? Did it help to integrate the Indian nation? Was Gandhi truly a Great Soul, a saint or a shrewd politician? In what ways is Gandhi received and remembered by the Indian nation today? How does understanding a figure like Gandhi facilitate our understanding of modern nationalism, citizenship and political action?",

Other topics covered include catalysis, enzyme kinetics, mechanism and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes; and the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins. In addition, the principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules are discussed. The in-person laboratory provides further opportunity to study macromolecules and to learn the fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis, chromatography, and principles of enzymatic assays. A laboratory section will also be provided for remote students, which will examine similar topics and techniques through literature and data analysis.",

Tropical issues have become prominent on a global scale, and many social issues in the tropics are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and physiology. The course highlights differences between the tropics and areas at higher latitudes. It begins with a survey of the tropical environment of humans, including major climatic and habitat features. The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes demography and the role of disease particularly malaria and AIDS. The final part of the course covers the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting ecological environment. This course fulfills the DPE requirement. Through lectures, debates and readings, students confront social issues and policies from the perspective of biologists. This builds a framework for lifelong exploration of human diversity in terms of difference, power and equity.",

How is that information represented? What are the limits on what can be sensed? We will look for answers to these questions by investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sensory transduction, and how these mechanisms constrain the types of information that the nervous system encodes and processes. We will also ask how natural selection shapes the type of sensory information that animals extract from the world, and what adaptations allow some species to have \"special\" senses. Some of the examples we will consider are: bat echolocation (hair cells in the ear), detecting visual motion (amacrine cells in the mammalian retina), the constant reshaping of the olfactory system (chemical mapping of odors), what makes a touch stimulus noxious, and enhanced color vision (in birds, bees, and shrimp). This course will be \"flipped\", with readings and on-line presentations to be done before class and in-class time devoted to short quizzes, additional explanations of the material, and discussions of the primary literature. Laboratory exercises will focus on the nematode C. elegans, an important model system, to explore and extend how we understand touch, temperature sensation, and chemosensation.",

And, how might physiological mechanisms at the organismal level scale up to influence population processes? This course uses an integrative approach to understand the impacts of climate change at multiple levels of biological organization in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. We examine physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses and the role of acclimation versus adaptation in coping with rapidly shifting thermal environments. We then consider the impacts of these mechanisms on whole organism performance and their consequences for population persistence. Finally, we learn the analytical tools used to incorporate physiological mechanisms into ecological models to predict future responses to global climate change. Class discussions will focus on readings drawn from the primary literature.",

We will begin by using thermodynamic principles to estimate the salient physiochemical properties of molecules (e.g., vapor pressure, solubility, charging behavior, etc.) that impact the distribution, or partitioning, of organic chemicals between air, water, soils, and biota. Then, using quantitative structure activity relationships, we will predict the degradation kinetics resulting from natural nucleophilic, photochemical, and biological processes that determine chemical lifetime in the environment.",

Taking a comparative approach, students will read and analyze Chinese literature produced in various regions and cultures at critical historical moments during the second half of the twentieth century and early years of the twenty-first century. When socialist realism gained momentum in literary works of the 1950s and 1960s China, for instance, how was literature being produced in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Southeast Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia? Students also read critical essays in studies of \u003cI\u003eShijie huawen wenxue\u003c/I\u003e (Global Chinese-language literature) to gain a theoretical understanding of the scholarship. The purpose of the course is two-fold: First, students are expected to expand their purview in studying Chinese-language literature and culture; second, students will learn to think critically the ways in which such concepts as Chinese and Chineseness travel and translate among peoples, regions, nations, and cultures. The course is conducted in English. The mode of teaching will be hybrid (online and in-person).",

      "descriptionSearch": "From early modern anxieties about China's status as the \"sick man of Asia\" to contemporary concerns regarding the prospect of transnational pandemics, \"illnesses\" and their related stories have played a critical role in making and contesting individual psychologies and Chinese modernity in the 20th and 21st centuries. Actual illnesses, from tuberculosis to AIDS to the Novel Coronavirus, constitute not only social realities that trouble political and popular minds in their own right; but further provide powerful metaphors for exploring issues of human rights, national identity, and transnational circulation. This course examines how Chinese literature in the 20th and 21st centuries writes and visualizes \"illness\"--a universal human experience that is nevertheless heavily bounded by culture and history. Specifically, we examine the cultural and social meaning of \"illness\"; the relationship between illness on the one hand, and the politics of body, gender, and class on the other; we ask how infectious disease, and mental illness are defined, represented, and understood in both male and female writers' analytical essays and fictional writings in the 20th century; we examine how metaphorical \"illness\" such as infectious cannibalism and fin-de-siècle \"viruses,\" are imagined and interpreted by key culture figures ranging from the founding father of modern literature (Lu Xun), to the winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature (Mo Yan). Throughout the course, we will focus on the interplay between literature canons (fictions, essays, and dramas) and popular media and genres: blockbuster cinemas and art house films, popular novels, photographs and posters, etc.",

Aspects of Classical Chinese continue to play a role in both written (e.g., in newspaper, academic, and legal writing) and in spoken (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms) modern Chinese. Our work in this course will be based on reading, translating, and discussing philosophical, political, literary, and historical anecdotes from the Spring and Autumn (770-481 BCE) through the Han (206 BCE-220 CE) periods, as they served as the foundation for the language. We will conduct discussions of grammatical and philological issues primarily in English and most of our translation work will be from Classical Chinese into English. We will, however, frequently discuss the points of intersection between Classical and Modern Chinese. Students are required to have completed CHIN 202 or the equivalent. Students who have extensive reading knowledge of Chinese characters through other languages (such as Japanese) may also take this course with the instructor's permission.",

From 1949, when the Nationalist Party (KMT) retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, to becoming one of the Four Asian Tigers in the latter half of the 20th century, Taiwan has developed into a multifaceted society through an array of social/cultural/economic changes associated with industrialization, globalization and identity formation. In this course, we will examine some of the signal examples of these experiences that define the Taiwan society that it is today through literary works and films, as well as journalistic and academic articles. By way of group discussions and individual projects, students will acquire domain-specific vocabulary and develop abilities to analyze and discuss in Mandarin complex ideas related to the aforementioned issues. Using a semi-tutorial format and collaborating with a graduate program in Chinese pedagogy in Taiwan, this course is designed to provide opportunities for Williams students to engage in direct conversation with a language partner on course assignments and for the MA students in Taiwan to gain practical training in helping non-native speakers of Mandarin Chinese develop linguistic proficiency at the levels of Advanced Low to the Advanced Mid based on the ACTFL proficiency guidelines.",

This fundamental pair of forces has shaped accounts of human experience for over two millennia. Are these principles simple opposites, complements, or even two aspects of a single concept? What happens when they fall out of balance or both are absent? Can love consume strife, or strife destroy love? Artists and writers have taken up these and similar questions in myriad forms, from nursery rhymes to epic poems, from philosophical contemplation to popular song, from the tragic stage to the silver screen. This course will use Greek and Latin works as touchstones for exploring ancient and modern representations of love and strife. Our ancient sources may include Homer, Sappho, Sophocles, Horace, Catullus, and Seneca, as well as architecture, graffiti, and epitaphs. Later sources may include Shakespeare and screwball comedies, Broadway standards and the Beatles, Renaissance fresco and modern sculpture, and literary professions of love from the silly to the sublime.

Why then should we spend our time studying people who in addition to having these surprising beliefs have been dead for 2500 years? First of all, Greek thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding of western intellectual history without some familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our understanding of our own situation. More importantly, many of the thinkers that we will read in this class are simply excellent philosophers, and it is worthwhile for anyone interested in philosophical problems to read treatments of these problems by excellent philosophers. We will begin the course by looking briefly at some of the Presocratic philosophers active in the Mediterranean world of the seventh through fifth centuries BCE, and some of the sophists active in the fifth century. We will then turn to several of Plato's dialogues, examining Plato's portrayal of Socrates and his development of a new and profoundly powerful philosophical conception. Finally, we will examine some of Aristotle's works on metaphysics, epistemology and ethics, considering some of the ways Aristotle's thought responds to that of predecessors.",

These are only a few of the fascinating questions that ancient readers and interpreters of the Book of Genesis asked and attempted to answer. The first ten chapters of Genesis present a tantalizingly brief narrative account of the earliest history of humankind. The text moves swiftly from the Creation to the Flood and its immediate aftermath, but this masterful economy of style leaves many details unexplained. This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions associated with the primeval history in the Genesis. Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to some continuations of these variant traditions in medieval literature, with particular attention to the material on the figures of Cain and Noah. \u003cI\u003eAll readings are in translation.\u003c/I\u003e",

Socrates famously prodded his students with questions while strolling through and beyond the city of Athens, and his intellectual descendant, Aristotle, enshrined the value of learning-in-motion through his Peripatetic (\"walking around\") school of philosophy. Here at Williams, the enduring image of \"the log\" idealizes direct dialogue between professor and student(s) in a natural setting. Henry David Thoreau, in a quote inscribed near the summit of Mt. Greylock, remarks that \"it were as well to be educated in the shadow of a mountain as in more classic shades. Some will remember, no doubt, not only that they went to college, but that they went to the mountain.\" In addition to celebrating outdoor learning, these models all valorize an education stripped of classroom and technological trappings--an education that requires only a curious mind and an intellectual guide. What might these models have to offer us in this extraordinary historical and cultural moment?\n\nIn Greek 201 this fall, we will read excerpts from Plato's \u003cI\u003eIon\u003c/I\u003e and Hesiod's \u003cI\u003eTheogony\u003c/I\u003e in their original Greek. These texts will give you a taste of both Classical prose and Archaic poetry and enable you to improve your ability to read, comprehend, and translate ancient Greek literature. Plato and Hesiod also offer important and influential perspectives on the origins, effects, and value of poetry, and we will use their work as a starting point for asking ourselves questions like: what is poetry? Where does it come from? What is it good for? In keeping with the minimalist models of education described above, we will explore those questions and read Greek together with as few trappings as possible: see \"additional information\" for course format details.",

      "descriptionSearch": "The comic plays that still survive all had their first productions within roughly forty years between 200 and 160 BCE, as Rome rapidly expanded its military, economic, and political reach beyond the Apennine peninsula. They present critically important evidence for how Roman literature and cultural identity developed in the second century, and they document formulas for slapstick action and low-brow jokes that remain in use even today. Staged in Greek costume and featuring ostensibly Greek characters, the comedies revel in mocking stereotypical Roman values but ultimately reassert them. Sometimes what the Romans found funny is all too familiar; sometimes it's shocking. Our main focus will be on the \u003cI\u003eMostellaria\u003c/I\u003e of Plautus, often translated as \"The Haunted House.\" Characteristic of its genre, the \u003cI\u003eMostellaria\u003c/I\u003e focuses on generational conflict within a household, especially between father and son. To enrich our conversation, we will read several other comedies in translation as well as selected scholarly investigations of this play, its genre, and the historical context.",

      "descriptionSearch": "This First Year tutorial, available in English, investigates the mutual mistrust between the two Germanies in the Cold War period up until the peaceful popular protests that brought down the Berlin Wall. The political tensions between communist East Germany, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and its capitalist Western counterpart, the Federal Republic (FRG), created a fascinating culture of governmental spying, but also led to aggravated periods of state surveillance of its own citizens. How were families affected across generations by these divisive politics, including the two states' differing treatment of the Nazi legacy? What was the involvement of the KGB and the CIA? How did East German intelligence try to destabilize the West from inside? Which locations in Berlin served as centers for spying, given that the city's terrain is quite flat and exposed? High-profile cases of conflicting loyalties include the Guillaume spy affair that brought down Willy Brandt as Chancellor of the FRG in 1974, and the Brasch family in the GDR, where the father, a communist true believer, turned his three sons over to the Stasi for their dissident activism and engaged art. We will debate filmic treatments of the recruitment of spies as double agents (\u003cI\u003eCoded Message for the Boss\u003c/I\u003e, 1979), the chilling effects of police surveillance during the Baader-Meinhof radical left terrorist attacks (\u003cI\u003eThe Lost Honor of Katharina Blum\u003c/I\u003e, 1975; \u003cI\u003eKnife in the Head\u003c/I\u003e, 1978) the afterlives of former terrorists who were offered new identities as 'ordinary' East Germans (\u003cI\u003eThe legend of Rita\u003c/I\u003e, 2000), to the effects of the Stasi files becoming accessible to their victims after the fall of the wall (\u003cI\u003eEs ist nicht vorbei, Anderson\u003c/I\u003e). We will also discuss popular film representations of spying in \u003cI\u003eLives of Others\u003c/I\u003e (2007) and \u003cI\u003eBridge of Spies\u003c/I\u003e (2015), and selected episodes from the popular TV-series \u003cI\u003eGermany 83 and 86\u003c/I\u003e (2018). Literature will likely include: Thomas Brasch, \u003cI\u003eThe Sons Die Before the Fathers\u003c/I\u003e (1977), Christa Wolf, \u003cI\u003eWhat Remains\u003c/I\u003e (1993), Monika Maron, \u003cI\u003eFlight of Ashes\u003c/I\u003e (1981), Heinrich Böll, \u003cI\u003eThe Lost Honour of Katharina Blum\u003c/I\u003e (1974).

Through readings, audiovisual materials, performance exercises, and discussions we will engage with theatre as a constantly evolving art form, sharpening our analytical skills through theoretical approaches from performance studies. Central to our exploration will be excavating the Eurocentric assumptions that conventionally shape the practice and study of theater in the United States. We will seek ways to decolonize our perspectives and ask critical questions about performance's potential to enact strategies of anti-racism and anti-imperialism. As a capstone project, students will create virtual performances.

Taking a comparative approach, students will read and analyze Chinese literature produced in various regions and cultures at critical historical moments during the second half of the twentieth century and early years of the twenty-first century. When socialist realism gained momentum in literary works of the 1950s and 1960s China, for instance, how was literature being produced in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Southeast Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia? Students also read critical essays in studies of \u003cI\u003eShijie huawen wenxue\u003c/I\u003e (Global Chinese-language literature) to gain a theoretical understanding of the scholarship. The purpose of the course is two-fold: First, students are expected to expand their purview in studying Chinese-language literature and culture; second, students will learn to think critically the ways in which such concepts as Chinese and Chineseness travel and translate among peoples, regions, nations, and cultures. The course is conducted in English. The mode of teaching will be hybrid (online and in-person).",

In this interdisciplinary course, we will consider these two developments both separately and together. As Renaissance humanists were acquiring a sophisticated understanding of the distance between the present and various European pasts (the recent medieval past and the remote history of antiquity), they were also coming into contact with non-European cultures in Africa, the Americas, and Asia via trade and economic development, imperial expansion, and religious conversion. Always at stake in these encounters was the question of who counted as an individual; the self was not considered to be intrinsic to human nature but rather the product of historical and cultural developments. Themes will include religious pluralism, the sacred and the secular, vernacularity, exploration and empire, the relationship between mind and body, slavery, trade, wealth, gender, self-fashioning, and style. We will consider such English writers as the Pearl poet, More, Marlowe, Spenser, Shakespeare, Browne, and Milton; such continental intellectuals as Descartes, Erasmus, Las Casas, and Castiglione; and such continental artists as Michelangelo, Velázquez, Bruegel, and Rembrandt.",

These are only a few of the fascinating questions that ancient readers and interpreters of the Book of Genesis asked and attempted to answer. The first ten chapters of Genesis present a tantalizingly brief narrative account of the earliest history of humankind. The text moves swiftly from the Creation to the Flood and its immediate aftermath, but this masterful economy of style leaves many details unexplained. This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions associated with the primeval history in the Genesis. Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to some continuations of these variant traditions in medieval literature, with particular attention to the material on the figures of Cain and Noah. \u003cI\u003eAll readings are in translation.\u003c/I\u003e",

Actual illnesses, from tuberculosis to AIDS to the Novel Coronavirus, constitute not only social realities that trouble political and popular minds in their own right; but further provide powerful metaphors for exploring issues of human rights, national identity, and transnational circulation. This course examines how Chinese literature in the 20th and 21st centuries writes and visualizes \"illness\"--a universal human experience that is nevertheless heavily bounded by culture and history. Specifically, we examine the cultural and social meaning of \"illness\"; the relationship between illness on the one hand, and the politics of body, gender, and class on the other; we ask how infectious disease, and mental illness are defined, represented, and understood in both male and female writers' analytical essays and fictional writings in the 20th century; we examine how metaphorical \"illness\" such as infectious cannibalism and fin-de-siècle \"viruses,\" are imagined and interpreted by key culture figures ranging from the founding father of modern literature (Lu Xun), to the winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature (Mo Yan).

This course investigates Japanese culture and compares it with our own, by examining Japanese literature about two universal human experiences--love and death--and asking how Japanese writers inflect these ideas in their work. The course begins with tales of doomed lovers that were popular in the eighteenth-century kabuki and puppet theaters, and that still feature prominently in Japanese popular culture today. From there we move on to a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and sacrifice, martyrdom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at an advanced age. We will focus on novels and short stories by canonical modern authors like Tanizaki, Kawabata, and Mishima, as well as contemporary popular fiction by writers like Murakami Haruki and Murakami Ryu.

But close examination of Franz Kafka's work and life reveals a multi-dimensional world that goes far beyond the cliché. Jewish in an increasingly anti-Semitic environment, German-speaking surrounded by Czech-speakers, deeply alone in a family that didn't understand him, Kafka produced texts that simultaneously demand and refuse to be interpreted. In this tutorial we will begin with intensive readings of selected short stories and parables, then move on to an exploration of the social, political, and intellectual context in which Kafka worked. The course will conclude with discussions of how both texts and context might be linked to our own contemporary conditions. This will be a modified tutorial, with five groups of three students apiece. Students may take the tutorial in either German or English; groups will be formed accordingly.",

It is organized around a series of encounters with figures from the poet's past--for example, a former teacher damned for violating nature--as well as historical and literary characters: Ulysses, Thomas Aquinas, Plato, Virgil, Adam. Though the Comedy is probably now best known for its savagery--the bodies split open, the Popes turned upside down and lit on fire--it is also, as Dante claims, a love story and a work of high imaginative daring. Among its final images is a vision of paradise rendered through the precise if also mind-bending language of non-Euclidean geometry. In this course we will read the three books of the Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso), the Vita Nuova, and a few brief selections from Dante's other works. All readings will be in translation.

The majority of these images have proven to be fake, however their popularity was witness to people's hope that we can \"reset\" the environment and a yearning to reframe animals' positionality vis-à-vis their habitats and humans. Using critical lenses from ecocriticism and animal studies, we will be exploring texts from non-Western traditions in which animals figure strongly from pre-modern times to the age of the Anthropocene. The focus will be on Arabic, Persian and Turkish texts all in translation. The course will be traversing several genres and texts from Pre-Islamic poetry, the Quran, the 10th century Ikhwan as-Safa's epistle \u003cI\u003eThe Case of Animals versus Man Before the King of the Jinn\u003c/I\u003e, the fables of \u003cI\u003eKalila and Dimna\u003c/I\u003e, Farid ed-Din 'Attar's \u003cI\u003eConference of Birds\u003c/I\u003e, travelogues, paintings, contemporary film till we reach recent fiction with cyborgs and drones. Throughout the course, we will be examining themes such as diverse conceptualizations of what it means to be an \"animal\", what constitutes' animal agency and animal subjectivity irrespective of humans and their often utilitarian lens. We will do this by investigating how animals through these texts have been represented, imagined and reconfigured whether allegorically or otherwise as communities and in relation to humans and the environment and the implications of that. Finally, we will explore what a poetics of animal studies in these cultural and literary traditions could look like.

Stories, in this view, are not only the stuff of literature, but also the very fabric of social life: the foundation for individual and collective identities. This course grapples with the role of stories and storytelling in modern social life. What role do stories play in constituting personal identity? What cultural templates structure the stories we tell? Why are memoirs so popular, and how can we explain the more recent resurgence of interest in oral forms of storytelling? What role does storytelling play in politics and social movements? Specific topics will include confessional culture, podcasts, memoir, politics, and social change.

However, the creation of the Alliance Israelite Universelle's schools (1830s), the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the decolonization process in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War accelerated the departure of Arab and Berber Jews from their homelands to other destinations, including France, Israel, Canada, the United States, and different Latin American countries. Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly. The course will help students understand the depth of Jewish life in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and interrogate the local and global factors that led to their disappearance from both social and cultural memories for a long time. Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world. Resisting both conflict and nostalgia as the primary determinants of Jewish-Muslim relations, the course will help students think about multiple ways in which Jews and Muslims formed communities of citizens despite their differences and disagreements.",

By carefully analyzing the structure of a problem within a mathematical framework, it is often possible to dramatically decrease the computational resources needed to find a solution. In addition, analysis provides a method for verifying the correctness of an algorithm and accurately estimating its running time and space requirements. We will study several algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136. These include induction, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Additional topics of study include algorithms on graphs and strategies for handling potentially intractable problems.",

The overarching goal of these questions is to understand and analyze selfish behavior and whether it can or should influence system design. Students will learn how to model and reason about incentives in computational systems both theoretically and empirically. Topics include types of equilibria, efficiency of equilibria, auction design, network games, two-sided markets, incentives in computational applications such as file sharing and cryptocurrencies, and computational social choice.",

Machine Learning is a field that derives from Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, and others, and aims to develop algorithms that will improve a system's performance. Improvement might involve acquiring new factual knowledge from data, learning to perform a new task, or learning to perform an old task more efficiently or effectively. This tutorial will cover examples of supervised learning algorithms (including Bayesian approaches, support vector machines, and neural networks -- both deep and traditional), unsupervised learning algorithms (including k-means and expectation maximization), and possibly reinforcement learning algorithms (such as Q learning and temporal difference learning). It will also introduce methods for the evaluation of learning algorithms, as well as topics in computational learning theory and ethics.",

Motown's Martha and the Vandellas introduced this song, which continues to be sung by contemporary artists as an expression of celebration and as a call to action.

Science and inventions impact how dance, music, visual art and information are made and shared causing culture and experiences to be witnessed and become meaningful beyond the boundaries of their origin. Creating for example, the globally evolving canon of Hip Hop.\n\nWe will consider:\n\n- How artists document major themes in social justice such as anti lynching movement across time through work such as Strange Fruit (as poetry, dance, visual art, music, media)\n\n- How the arts documented the 1950's-80's in selected communities such as New York City, Los Angeles, Detroit, Kingston, Johannesburg, Atlanta, Rio, Chicago, Havana, Port au Prince, Lagos and Accra\n\n- Selected dance forms such as Charleston, Lindy Hop, Hip Hop, Electric Slide, Vogue, Stepping and Rumba as documents in motion\n\n- Contemporary choreographers Camille Brown, Rennie Harris , Vincent Mantsoe and Ephrat Asherie use social dance as an anchor for choreography\n\n- Music of the Black Lives Matter, Say Her Name and Civil Rights Movements\n\nCourse meetings will include:\n\n- Study of designated social dance\n\n- Making solo and group dances\n\n- Learning selected songs\n\n- Discussion of selected readings, media and works of visual art in class meetings\n\n- Showing of individual and group generated performance and or media or text based material",

      "descriptionSearch": "\"Dance is the fist with which I fight the sickening ignorance of prejudice.\" -Pearl Primus\n\nEarly 20th century modern dance exemplified embodied rebellion. The body as a tool for expression, social critique and resistance evolved radically, as the work of modern dance artists in the U.S. exposed and dismantled restrictive aspects of the racial and social dynamics of the 20th century, especially for women and people of color. We will examine particular artists' voices that arose with new aesthetic and thematic concerns in the struggle for artistic freedom and social justice, while examining why some, and not others, had opportunities to advance their art.\n\nWe will investigate key artists and works in the historic canon in order to understand the ways in which bodies rebel, overtly and covertly, to guide us in the power and importance of embodied resistance. Virtual class visits with artists active in the reconstruction and performance of works of protest such as Talley Beatty's \u003cI\u003eMourne's Bench\u003c/I\u003e, Jane Dudley's \u003cI\u003eTime is Money\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eHarmonica Breakdown\u003c/I\u003e, Martha Graham's \u003cI\u003eChronicle\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eDeep Song\u003c/I\u003e, Pearl Primus' \u003cI\u003eStrange Fruit\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eHard Time Blues\u003c/I\u003e, Sophie Maslow's \u003cI\u003eDustbowl Ballads\u003c/I\u003e, and Anna Sokolow's \u003cI\u003eSlaughter of the Innocents\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003eRooms\u003c/I\u003e will enhance our dialogue. We will also connect these historic pieces to the work of current artists such as Dr. Shamell Bell and Akram Khan.\n\nWe will learn to \"read\" dance as a language and to develop a critical framework by examining, for example, how we define bodily innovation, what a work reflects about its time, its creator, and the place of dance in society, how the body is constructed/deconstructed in the work, spiritual practice in relation to dance-making, the social identity of the creator and the performers, and the role of music/sound/text in relation to movement expression. We will periodically practice movement ideas in workshops designed for any student; no previous dance experience is expected or required.\n\nThe class will collaboratively develop final project(s) on our chosen themes, using movement, sound, and research to develop our own call(s) to action.

      "descriptionSearch": "\"What does dance give you?\" asked the great African American dancer, teacher, and director Arthur Mitchell: \"The freedom to be who you are and do what you want to do.\" In the ballet world, however, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color have struggled to achieve that \"freedom\" their white counterparts have enjoyed. In this course students continue their technical/artistic training in ballet while also exploring different topics in past and current ballet history; in Fall 2020, our main focus will be on some of the notable BIPOC figures in the world of ballet, with the history of ballet providing both a timeline and a sociopolitical backdrop against which we can trace and discover the intersectionality that has helped shape the aesthetics of ballet as well as other genres we know today. Though this is primarily a studio course (with in-studio or online ballet technique classes given twice-weekly; see formats below) readings and viewings relevant to our coursework will be assigned; a third weekly meeting will be held for virtual group discussions on those assignments.

      "descriptionSearch": "\"What does dance give you?\" asked the great African American dancer, teacher, and director Arthur Mitchell: \"The freedom to be who you are and do what you want to do.\" In the ballet world, however, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color have struggled to achieve that \"freedom\" their white counterparts have enjoyed. In this course students continue their technical/artistic training in ballet while also exploring different topics in past and current ballet history; in Fall 2020, our main focus will be on some of the notable BIPOC figures in the world of ballet, with the history of ballet providing both a timeline and a sociopolitical backdrop against which we can trace and discover the intersectionality that has helped shape the aesthetics of ballet as well as other genres we know today. Though this is primarily a studio course (with in-studio or online ballet technique classes given twice-weekly; see formats below) readings and viewings relevant to our coursework will be assigned; a third weekly meeting will be held for virtual group discussions on those assignments. Alongside broader ballet history texts, the essays and articles by authors such as Brenda Dixon Gottschild and Theresa Ruth Howard will offer keen insights into some of the more specific issues and topics regarding race and diversity in the field of ballet.

The course material will primarily focus on books by artist-scholars of color with the aim of engaging with both the politics of identity in performance and also the politics of texts and archives. Each of the texts we encounter will be paired with visual materials and/or virtual conversation with artist-scholars to encourage a multilayered experience with writing about performance. Besides engaging deeply with the selected monographs, we will practice skills related to writing creatively and analytically about movement-based performance.\n\nThis class will be held remotely and will include a combination of tutorial-like small group meetings, periodic synchronous sessions, and asynchronous work such as Glow posts or recorded lectures. The course is reading and writing intensive, and oriented towards juniors, seniors, and those with deep interest in analytical and creative writing. Students will (i) read several monographs during the semester, (ii) participate in discussions about course materials, (iii) produce creative and critical writing (at least 5-6 pages every two weeks and a final cumulative assignment), and (iv) engage in the revision process of their own work and that of their peers based on feedback from the professor and from writing partners.",

Some argue that we need to slow or even end economic growth to prevent environmental catastrophe. Others argue that market forces, especially changing prices and improved technology, will ensure that growth can continue unabated without significant negative consequences. Still others argue that government intervention is necessary to limit negative consequences of economic progress, but that effective interventions are still compatible with sustained economic growth.\n\nIn this class, we will explore the insights that economics has to offer on this important question. We will start by considering the importance of finite inputs used in production, including fossil fuels, minerals, and land, among others. Then, we will consider whether undesirable byproducts of economic growth will prevent sustained growth. This second part of class will place a lot of emphasis on climate change. Throughout the class, we will pay special attention to the role that government intervention can or cannot play in promoting sustainable economic growth. This class will reinforce important concepts taught in introductory microeconomics and introductory macroeconomics.",

The second part considers mid-20th-century writers who revise and critique economic liberalism from a variety of perspectives, including Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Ronald Coase, Arthur Okun, and Albert O. Hirschman. The third part surveys significant recent contributions relevant to the themes of the course, with applications to current public policy issues, including topics such as: power relations and autonomy in the workplace; asymmetric information and social insurance; economic inequality and distributive justice; equality of opportunity; the economics of health care; positional goods and the moral foundations of capitalism; economic nationalism and new trade theory; behavioral economics; climate change and intergenerational equity; finance and financial crises; and rent-seeking. The combination of the historical focus of the early part of the course with discussion of modern policy issues and debates in the latter part of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy.",

These policies include social insurance programs such as Unemployment Insurance; safety net programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, and housing assistance; education programs such as Head Start and public education; and parts of the tax code including the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. We will explore the design and functioning of these programs, focusing on questions economists typically ask when evaluating public policy such as: What are the goals of the policy and does the policy achieve them? Does the design of the policy lead to unintended effects (either good or bad)? What are the trade-offs inherent in the policy's design? Could the policy be redesigned to achieve its goals more effectively? Through in-depth study of these programs, students will learn how economists bring theoretical models and empirical evidence to bear on important questions of public policy.",

Motivated by several stylized facts from cross-country data, we will pose a series of questions: Why are some countries so rich while others remain so poor? What explains heterogeneity in the experience of economic growth across nations, with some growing at a moderate pace over long periods of time, others experiencing rapid growth over shorter intervals, and yet others stagnating persistently? Do all economies face comparable challenges to achieving sustained economic growth? Will poorer countries ever catch up to richer ones? To answer these and other related questions, we will explore the underlying mechanisms of economic growth. What role is played by savings and investment (i.e., the accumulation of physical capital)? What is the influence of population growth? How important are investments in human capital (i.e., education and population health)? What about technological differences across nations? How much significance should we ascribe to cross-country differences in geographical characteristics? How much should we ascribe to differences in the quality of institutions? For each question, we will explore both theoretical and empirical approaches, ranging from formal models to qualitative historical evidence to cross-country growth regressions. We will debate the usefulness of these different approaches for development policy and will discuss the reasons why so many questions about global economic inequality remain difficult to answer.",

Next we will study adaptation, including capital investments and behavioral changes. We will examine the sources of climate change, especially electricity generation and transportation, and think about optimal policies. What is the socially optimal amount of climate change? Why have countries had such a hard time agreeing on GHG emissions reductions, and how might we overcome such difficulties? We will consider the growing body of evidence from attempts to regulate GHGs, including China's cap-and-trade programs, the EU ETS, and US state policies.

In industrialized countries, most households contain at least one wage earner, and income from working represents the largest component of total income. Thus analyses of the labor market are fundamentally relevant to both public policy and private decision-making. This seminar will explore the structure and functioning of the labor market using theoretical and empirical tools. Topics to be covered include labor supply and demand, minimum wages, labor market effects of social insurance and welfare programs, the collective bargaining relationship, discrimination, human capital, immigration, wage distribution, and unemployment. As labor economics is an intensely empirical subfield, students will be expected to analyze data as well as study the empirical work of others.",

This seminar begins from theories of optimizing worker behavior in the presence of pollution.

We will also study the impact of pollution regulations on wages and employment. Included papers will cover both developed and developing countries.",

An important topic in the course will be studying how financial market imperfections amplify and propagate shocks to the aggregate economy. The course may cover the following topics: the determination of asset prices in general equilibrium; consequences of limited asset markets for economic efficiency; theoretical foundations of financial contracts and justifications for the existence of financial intermediaries; the roles of financial frictions in magnifying aggregate fluctuations and creating persistence and instability; the role of leverage and financial innovation in fueling financial crises.",

Next we will study adaptation, including capital investments and behavioral changes. We will examine the sources of climate change, especially electricity generation and transportation, and think about optimal policies. What is the socially optimal amount of climate change? Why have countries had such a hard time agreeing on GHG emissions reductions, and how might we overcome such difficulties? We will consider the growing body of evidence from attempts to regulate GHGs, including China's cap-and-trade programs, the EU ETS, and US state policies.

So how to go about the task of reading literature well, and reading critically? This course will focus on key introductory methods and critical approaches, and is intended to develop your skills in reading, writing about, discussing and interpreting literary texts.

American drama abounds with hidden knowledge and false representations. (This is not surprising: theatre is always on some level a deceptive practice, a place where one person pretends to be another, and where what is spoken is always open to skeptical scrutiny. We might say theatre is always lying as much as lying is always theatre.) This tutorial course will examine what lies hidden in American plays from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Beginning with excerpted critical and historical writings on secrecy and lying (\u003cI\u003eThe Adventures of Pinocchio\u003c/I\u003e, Machiavelli's \u003cI\u003eThe Prince\u003c/I\u003e, Thomas Carlson's \u003cI\u003eLying and Deception: Theory and Practice\u003c/I\u003e, among others), we will proceed to a set of American plays from across a wide spectrum of playwrights, including Eugene O'Neill, Edward Albee, Sarah Ruhl, Arthur Miller, Amy Herzog, Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, Annie Baker, and others.  Student papers will explore how hidden knowledge structures dramatic action, how different characters create and respond to untruths, and what can we learn in particular from \u003cI\u003eAmerican\u003c/I\u003e drama about a national relationship to honesty and its opposites. For Fall 2020, the tutorial will be conducted primarily online. Depending on enrollments, we may divide into groups with three students, instead of the traditional two-student tutorial format.",

More broadly conceived, the genre includes works lamenting other kinds of loss as well: the loss of a lover, place, country, or cherished version of one's past. We'll consider the special challenges and opportunities of the elegiac voice: how it manages to give public expression to private grief; negotiates problems of tone and perspective; worries about and celebrates the capacity of language to generate hope and consolation; and seeks a kind of solace in the literary effort to evoke, preserve, or rewrite a lost life or an absent past. This course focuses primarily on poetry, English and American, across a broad historical range. We'll first read poems from 1600-1900--including works by Jonson, Milton, Donne, Dryden, Gray, Shelley, Tennyson, and Whitman, and then turn to some of the twentieth-century's great poetic elegists--Owen, Yeats, Auden, Lowell, and Heaney.

In this interdisciplinary course, we will consider these two developments both separately and together. As Renaissance humanists were acquiring a sophisticated understanding of the distance between the present and various European pasts (the recent medieval past and the remote history of antiquity), they were also coming into contact with non-European cultures in Africa, the Americas, and Asia via trade and economic development, imperial expansion, and religious conversion. Always at stake in these encounters was the question of who counted as an individual; the self was not considered to be intrinsic to human nature but rather the product of historical and cultural developments. Themes will include religious pluralism, the sacred and the secular, vernacularity, exploration and empire, the relationship between mind and body, slavery, trade, wealth, gender, self-fashioning, and style. We will consider such English writers as the Pearl poet, More, Marlowe, Spenser, Shakespeare, Browne, and Milton; such continental intellectuals as Descartes, Erasmus, Las Casas, and Castiglione; and such continental artists as Michelangelo, Velázquez, Bruegel, and Rembrandt.",

Buddhist ideas and practices now seem ubiquitous, available even in the form of smartphone apps like Headspace and Ten Percent Happier. In this class, we'll explore how Buddhism came to be the profoundly important cultural force in American life that it is today. We'll read a variety of Buddhist-influenced literary texts, from the Beat poetry of the 1950s to contemporary novels like Ruth Ozeki's \u003cI\u003eA Tale for the Time Being\u003c/I\u003e. And we'll range far beyond the world of literature into other cultural domains in which Buddhism has had a deep impact, like environmentalism, psychotherapy, and Western attitudes towards death and dying. We'll also give special attention to the role that Buddhism is playing in the struggle for racial justice (from bell hooks to Black Lives Matter). And we'll engage in an experiential investigation of the benefits of incorporating contemplative practices like mindfulness into higher education: students will learn a variety of meditation techniques, and we'll spend time each week practicing and reflecting upon those practices. Students will be expected to maintain a daily meditation practice outside of class (10-15 minutes a day), with the help of one of those newfangled meditation apps no less! No prior experience with meditation is necessary. Just an open mind. (For detailed information about the format of this hybrid course, please visit: www.tinyurl.com/Engl239)",

It is organized around a series of encounters with figures from the poet's past--for example, a former teacher damned for violating nature--as well as historical and literary characters: Ulysses, Thomas Aquinas, Plato, Virgil, Adam. Though the Comedy is probably now best known for its savagery--the bodies split open, the Popes turned upside down and lit on fire--it is also, as Dante claims, a love story and a work of high imaginative daring. Among its final images is a vision of paradise rendered through the precise if also mind-bending language of non-Euclidean geometry. In this course we will read the three books of the Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso), the Vita Nuova, and a few brief selections from Dante's other works. All readings will be in translation.

But beyond the economic logic of conservation and expenditure, might imagining the world from the vantage point of its limit provoke a more profound rethinking of ourselves and the things of the world?

      "descriptionSearch": "In nineteenth-century Britain, the novel took on the world. Shaking off its early disrepute, and taking advantage of growing literacy and innovations in production and distribution, it achieved in this period an unrivalled synthesis of mass appeal and aesthetic and social ambition. Its representational aspirations were breathtaking: attempting to comprehend in its pages the dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as to delineate in finest detail the texture of individual lives and minds. In an age obsessed with the social, it engaged directly with the most compelling issues of the day, including industrialization and the gap between rich and poor, the role of women, nationalism and imperialism, and more broadly, the very nature of historical change itself. But it did so, for the most part, by telling fine-grained stories of ordinary men and women, people trying to make a living, worrying about their families and their neighbors, facing illness and death, and falling in--and sometimes out of--love. Since so many of these stories remain highly accessible works of popular culture, we will work hard to focus on what is strange and specific about the fiction of the nineteenth century, while also recognizing the roots of much that is modern in our own culture. We will also take seriously their social ambitions, looking especially at the ways they formulate, promote, and contest their readers' understanding of themselves as subjects and agents of an ongoing social history. Likely authors include Jane Austen, Walter Scott, Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, and George Eliot.",

Many, however, are unaware of the decades-long cinematic movement to which Dash belongs. In this course, we will devote our critical inquiry to the creative output of the L.A. Rebellion, a group of Black cinematic artists trained at the UCLA Film and Television School between the 1960s and 1990s. Our visual journey will take us through a diverse set of filmmakers like Charles Burnett, Ben Caldwell, Barbara McCullough, Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Haile Gerima, Alile Sharon Larkin, Billy Woodberry, among many, many others, and how they sought to not only redefine the Black image on-screen but also reimagine the infinite possibilities of Blackness. We will pay close attention to the heterogeneity of genres, styles, and techniques that they put into practice from narrative to neorealism to documentary to avant-garde/experimental to African and African American musical and storytelling traditions. We will explore the various social and political issues that were represented by their films including: racial and class oppression, Black feminisms, Black Power, Afrocentrism, anti-colonialism and decolonization, police brutality and mass incarceration, radical social movements and coalition building, and the importance of community-based art and film practices. Finally, we will touch upon some of the recent works that have been inspired by the L.A. Rebellion, including the aforementioned \u003cI\u003eLemonade\u003c/I\u003e and Barry Jenkins' \u003cI\u003eMoonlight\u003c/I\u003e (2016).

This course will be a joint adventure in the reception and production of such projects, and is designed for anyone interested in the intersections of archival research and creative writing. Part of our work will be to historicize and theorize this mode of literary making, which emerges out of Modernist experiments in polyvocality, collage, and what Ezra Pound termed the \"poem including history.\" We will begin the semester by looking at Muriel Rukeyser's 1938 poetic sequence, \"The Book of the Dead,\" which exposes the complicity of Union Carbide in the silicosis contracted by the miners who dug the Hawk's Nest Tunnel in Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. Rukeyser wrote of her desire for a \"poetry [that] can extend the document\"; our subsequent readings in this course will look to a number of contemporary book-length projects that do just that. Our documentary models--by such writers as Heimrad Bäcker, Anne Carson, Layli Long Soldier, Don Mee Choi, M. NourbSe Philip, Mark Nowak, and Claudia Rankine--treat a wide range of subjects, yet all share both an investigative approach and a commitment to thinking about the way individual lives are shaped by larger social and historical structures. Generically, these works make use of the strategies of poetry, but also frequently incorporate essay, narrative, and image to create distinctly mixed forms. Students likewise will choose topics to investigate over the term, conducting original archival research and thinking inductively through the material toward a final project that will be shared with the public on our course website.",

In this discussion class, we will consider wonder as an eminently analyzable concept, but one that raises provocative questions about the nature and limits of our own, distinctly modern forms of critical engagement. The course examines three historical incarnations of \"wonder,\" each involving complex relations among the aesthetic, philosophical, and social domains: the Renaissance tradition on wonder and the marvelous (strange births, sea monsters, etc); the eighteenth-century analysis of the sublime; and twentieth-century accounts of the culture of spectacle, including cinema. We will consider writers such as Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and W.G. Sebald (all wonderful); painters such as Vermeer and Friedrich, the photography of Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth; films including Lang's \u003cI\u003eMetropolis\u003c/I\u003e, Scott's \u003cI\u003eBlade Runner\u003c/I\u003e and Pipilotti Rist; and critical or philosophical writers, including Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Benjamin, and Irigaray.",

Drama as a genre, with its constant negotiation of the competing claims of illusion and the operations of reality, is invariably interested in the exploration of social identity, in the tensions between public and private selfhood, and in the functions of 'performance'.  In this course we will examine theatre's response to the challenge of self-fashioning in the modern era, and consider the wider ontological status of performance as a category within the context of twentieth century drama and theatrical staging. Readings will include Shakespeare's \u003cI\u003eHamlet\u003c/I\u003e and plays by Chekhov, Pirandello, Churchill, Shepard, Lori-Parks, Beckett, Walcott, Pinter and others, along with selected criticism, theory, and psychoanalytical writings.",

In his essays on comedy and American culture, Ellison comments trenchantly on\u003cI\u003e Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u003c/I\u003e.  Melville and Mark Twain were, in many obvious ways, as different as two writers can be. Nonetheless, they also have many surprising similarities, and it is not difficult to understand why both are so important to Ellison. This course will examine the novels, stories, and essays of these three writers, with particular attention to the themes that they have in common and to the traits that make each of them distinctive.  Race, slavery, epistemology, and the nature of American democracy are among those themes.",

From extreme floods and drought to landslides and soil erosion, the natural processes that shape Earth's surface are tied to temperature and precipitation. As those change, the landscape reacts. People are beginning to feel the impacts, but in different ways depending on where they call home. In this course, we will investigate how climate change is altering landscapes and the natural processes that support them, highlighting all the ways that people are being affected today. Ultimately, we will develop an understanding of the consequences of climate change that connects physical processes with the geography of place. Specific topics include foundations of the Earth system, plate tectonics and the construction of landscapes, Earth materials, rivers and flooding, hillslope processes, coastal processes, and climate impacts on natural resources such as fresh water and soil. Labs will use local field sites and analytical exercises to evaluate recent cases that reflect an interaction of the landscape and climate.

Tropical issues have become prominent on a global scale, and many social issues in the tropics are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and physiology. The course highlights differences between the tropics and areas at higher latitudes. It begins with a survey of the tropical environment of humans, including major climatic and habitat features. The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes demography and the role of disease particularly malaria and AIDS. The final part of the course covers the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting ecological environment. This course fulfills the DPE requirement. Through lectures, debates and readings, students confront social issues and policies from the perspective of biologists. This builds a framework for lifelong exploration of human diversity in terms of difference, power and equity.",

In this course we will study the components of the climate system (atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, biosphere and land surface) and the processes through which they interact. Greenhouse gas emission scenarios will form the basis for investigating how these systems might respond to human activity. This course will explore how heat and mass are moved around the atmosphere and ocean to demonstrate how the geographic patterns of climate change arise. We will also focus on climate feedback effects--like the albedo feedback associated with sea ice and glacier loss--and how these processes can accelerate climate change.

They form above mantle plume hot spots (Hawaiian and Galapagos Islands), subduction zones (Aleutian and Indonesian arcs), and mid-ocean ridges (Azores and Ascension Island). Iceland is unusual because it is located above a hot spot and the mid-Atlantic ridge. Each plate tectonic setting produces chemically distinctive magmas, and the lifespan of volcanic islands varies widely. Islands above hot spots may be geographically remote and emergent for only several million years, but be part of a long-lived sequence of islands that persists for over a hundred million years. In contrast, island arc volcanoes belong to long geographically continuous chains of volcanoes, commonly in close proximity to continents. This tutorial explores the geologic evolution and lifespan of volcanic islands from formation to submergence, and searches for correlations between these characteristics and plate tectonic setting. We will also consider how geographic isolation, areal extent, lifespan, and climate affect biological evolution on volcanic islands.There will be weekly tutorial meetings with pairs of students, and students will alternate writing papers on assigned topics.

      "descriptionSearch": "Former President Barack Obama once said: \"There's one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent threat of a changing climate.\" While consensus regarding the causes and impacts of climate change has been growing steadily among scientists and researchers (and to some extent, the general public) over the past two decades, the U.S. has yet to confront this issue in a manner consistent with its urgency. This lack of action in the U.S. is at least partly due to the fact that science provides necessary but insufficient information towards crafting effective climate change legislation and the unfortunate fact that climate change has become a highly partisan issue. The primary objective of this tutorial will be to help students develop a greater understanding of the difficulties associated with crafting climate change legislation, with an emphasis on the role of science and politics within the legislative process. To this end, the tutorial will address how the underlying scientific complexities embedded in most climate policies (e.g., offsets, carbon capture and sequestration, uncertainty and complexity of the climate system, leakage) must be balanced by and blended with the different operational value systems (e.g., economic, social, cultural, religious) that underlie U.S. politics. Over the course of this tutorial, students will develop a nuanced sense of how and when science can support the development of comprehensive national climate change legislation within the current partisan climate. This course will take a practical approach, where students will craft weekly policy oriented documents (e.g., policy memos, action memos, research briefs) targeted to selected members of the current U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the committee that has historically held jurisdiction over a majority of the major climate change bills that have moved through the legislative process.

Others argue that market forces, especially changing prices and improved technology, will ensure that growth can continue unabated without significant negative consequences. Still others argue that government intervention is necessary to limit negative consequences of economic progress, but that effective interventions are still compatible with sustained economic growth.\n\nIn this class, we will explore the insights that economics has to offer on this important question. We will start by considering the importance of finite inputs used in production, including fossil fuels, minerals, and land, among others. Then, we will consider whether undesirable byproducts of economic growth will prevent sustained growth. This second part of class will place a lot of emphasis on climate change. Throughout the class, we will pay special attention to the role that government intervention can or cannot play in promoting sustainable economic growth.

Hydrothermal vents are extreme environments which host unique organisms, like giant tubeworms and giant hydrothermal clams, that are found only at these deep sea oases. This tutorial will examine how and where hydrothermal vents form, the strange and ancient life there, and why they are relevant despite feeling so far removed from our daily lives.

Are you curious why black-eyed peas and collards are considered \"soul food\"? In this course, we will answer these questions by digging in to the histories of global environmental transformation through colonialism, slavery, and international migration. We will consider the production and consumption of food as a locus of power over the last 300 years. Beginning with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade and continuing through the 20th century, we trace the global movement of plants, foods, flavors, workers, businesses, and agricultural knowledge. Major units include rice production by enslaved people in the Americas; Asian American food histories during the Cold War; and fat studies critiques of obesity discourse. We will discuss food justice, food sovereignty, and contemporary movements for food sustainability in the context of these histories and our contemporary world. Readings are interdisciplinary, but our emphasis will be on historical analyses of race, labor, environment, health, and gender.",

Its roles as a cultural symbol, resource, highway, and climate regulator make it essential to life around the world. This interdisciplinary course, team-taught by the faculty of the Williams-Mystic Program, will examine key issues in each of the world's oceans while introducing students to the ways these issues connect multiple disciplines and transcend physical, political, and imaginary ocean boundaries. By drawing on the expertise of the five professors -- from humanities, social sciences, and sciences -- this course facilitates the critical study of the ocean from an interdisciplinary perspective and helps them consider their own role in the shifting relationship between humanity and the ocean. This seminar-style course will meet twice a week online, with students assessed by their participation, response papers, and final project, while helping them apply interdisciplinary skills to pressing sustainability issues connecting the environment and society.",

Corals can thrive in nutrient-poor oceans because of the mutualistic relationship with algal symbionts. And as a foundational species, corals provide a habitat for numerous species, possibly the highest diversity found on the planet. However, these complex and beautiful ecosystems are declining worldwide from a variety of local and global threats. In this course, we will explore coral reef ecology through an in-depth examination of the biotic and abiotic factors contributing to the ecosystem's functioning. We will also investigate the causes and consequences of threats to coral reefs, such as ocean warming, ocean acidification, and resource extraction. Finally, we will identify the many efforts worldwide to conserve coral reefs and promote their resilience. In this seminar course, offered remotely, you will demonstrate your proficiency through knowledge assessments, short writing reflections, a virtual coral fragmentation experiment, and a creative advocacy project. This course aims to deepen your awareness of the complex species interactions on coral reefs and the physical factors affecting coral survival while fostering hope through current conservation efforts.",

Access to innovative technological, scientific, financial and legal resources is controlled by policy makers. Equal access is critical for the sustainability of our coastal communities. But fair decisions require vulnerable communities to have a voice in local climate change adaptation decisions. This seminar course will introduce you to basic concepts of climate justice in the context of our Nation's coastal communities, guided by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The course will introduce you to fundamental coastal and ocean-based climate-induced impacts with a focus on sea level rise, ocean warming, ocean acidification and coastal infrastructure. We will examine these impacts, as well as local, state, regional and federal policy responses to them through the lens of climate justice. We will identify what's working and what more needs to be done to advance climate equity and justice in the wake of formidable global and local change. Proficiency will be demonstrated through class participation, work conducted in small group strategy exercises, discussion board posts, short research assessment papers and a final written project. There are three goals in this course: first to broaden your understanding of the disproportionate effects of climate change to underrepresented, disempowered, poor, urban and indigenous populations living in American coastal communities; second to provide you with tools to identify inequity; third, to increase your own voice to promote avenues to seek climate justice.",

We will consider how literary and philosophical texts from the aforementioned time periods depict nature, how real-world interactions with nature led to the creation of (illustrated) taxonomies, how colonization inflected notions of the natural world and also museum exhibits, and finally, how the cabinet of curiosities and later, the museum, provided a space in which to display and analyze nature's more unusual treasures.

The majority of these images have proven to be fake, however their popularity was witness to people's hope that we can \"reset\" the environment and a yearning to reframe animals' positionality vis-à-vis their habitats and humans. Using critical lenses from ecocriticism and animal studies, we will be exploring texts from non-Western traditions in which animals figure strongly from pre-modern times to the age of the Anthropocene. The focus will be on Arabic, Persian and Turkish texts all in translation. The course will be traversing several genres and texts from Pre-Islamic poetry, the Quran, the 10th century Ikhwan as-Safa's epistle \u003cI\u003eThe Case of Animals versus Man Before the King of the Jinn\u003c/I\u003e, the fables of \u003cI\u003eKalila and Dimna\u003c/I\u003e, Farid ed-Din 'Attar's \u003cI\u003eConference of Birds\u003c/I\u003e, travelogues, paintings, contemporary film till we reach recent fiction with cyborgs and drones. Throughout the course, we will be examining themes such as diverse conceptualizations of what it means to be an \"animal\", what constitutes' animal agency and animal subjectivity irrespective of humans and their often utilitarian lens. We will do this by investigating how animals through these texts have been represented, imagined and reconfigured whether allegorically or otherwise as communities and in relation to humans and the environment and the implications of that. Finally, we will explore what a poetics of animal studies in these cultural and literary traditions could look like.

What are the local and global economies of waste in which we are all embedded and how are they structured by class, race, caste, gender and nation? In this seminar we critically examine the production of waste - both as material and as category - and its role in the production of value, meaning, hierarchy and the environment. Readings include ethnographic accounts of sanitation labor and social hierarchy; studies of the political and environmental consequences of systems of waste management in the colonial period and the present; and theoretical inquiries into the relation between filth and culture, including work by Mary Douglas, Dipesh Chakrabarty and Karl Marx. Geographically the foci are South Asia, Japan, and the United States. There is also a fieldwork component to the course. In (safe, socially distant) fieldtrips we follow the waste streams flowing out of Williams - to an incinerator, a sewage treatment plant, recycling and composting facilities and other sites - and students individually explore the everyday social life of waste in our communities.",

But beyond the economic logic of conservation and expenditure, might imagining the world from the vantage point of its limit provoke a more profound rethinking of ourselves and the things of the world? Does it change what it means to possess, or even what an experience of the world is? Does it change human relationship?

Why have countries had such a hard time agreeing on GHG emissions reductions, and how might we overcome such difficulties?

Over the course of the class, students will explore different conceptualizations of sustainability and how these conceptualizations take form in built environments in response to the cultural identities, political agendas, social norms, gender roles, and religious values circulating in society at any given moment. In recognizing the relationship between the way things are constructed (technique of assembly, technology, materials, process) and the deeper meanings behind the structural languages deployed, students will come to understand sustainability as a fundamentally context-specific ideal, and its manifestation within the architectural environment as a mode of producing dialogues about the anticipated futures of both cultural and architectural worlds.",

Anchored in the contexts of U.S. colonialisms, racialization, and accumulation, this course aims to expose students to the cultural politics of \"nature\" as a way of \"doing\" American Studies. Specifically, this course investigates formations of and struggles against U.S. colonialisms, racialization, and accumulation via the many symbolic and material iterations, negotiations, and contestations of the contingent relations between and among human and non-human natures. Organized around a significant research paper and weekly written responses, this course ultimately aims to foster students' critical writing, reading, analytical thinking, and comparative inquiry skills across such contexts and sites of contestation, and across texts of different genres and media. We will work with a wide range of primary sources, including published fiction and poetry, legal documents, newspaper articles, speeches, recorded songs, and films, photos, paintings and other visual culture. By the end of this course, students should be able to describe the historical foundations of dominant ideas, attitudes, and practices toward non-human natures, as well as analyze how ideas of \"nature\" mediate the ways in which colonial, racial, gender, and sexual categories and structures inform and are (re)produced by U.S. institutions and in public areas such as the law, public policy, and property. Finally, students should be able to interpret how racialized and colonized peoples' visions, representations, and practices of liberation with regard to relations with non-human natures and the materiality of land precede, contend with, and exceed normative political, economic, and social categories of governance and systems of dispossession and exploitation.",

At the broadest level, they profoundly altered spatial residential geography (especially in terms of race), consumer expectations and behavior, governmental policies, cultural norms and assumptions, societal connections, and Americans' relationship to nature. More specifically, the different waves of post-World War II suburban development have both reflected large-scale shifts in how power and money have operated in the American political economy; and set in motion deep-seated changes in electoral politics, in Americans' understandings of how their income should be used, and in how the built landscape should be re-imagined. This tutorial will explore the rich historical literature that has emerged over the last twenty years to provide students with a history of the suburbs, to see the suburbs as more than simply collections of houses that drew individual homeowners who wanted to leave urban areas.  We will focus most of our attention on the period from 1945 through the 1980s.  Some of the questions we will consider will include:  how did the first wave of suburban development bring together postwar racial and Cold War ideologies? Is it possible, as one historian has argued, that suburbs actually created the environmental movement of the 1960s? And how have historians understood the role that suburbs played in America's conservative political turn, leading to the election of Ronald Reagan?",

Through readings, audiovisual materials, performance exercises, and discussions we will engage with theatre as a constantly evolving art form, sharpening our analytical skills through theoretical approaches from performance studies. Central to our exploration will be excavating the Eurocentric assumptions that conventionally shape the practice and study of theater in the United States. We will seek ways to decolonize our perspectives and ask critical questions about performance's potential to enact strategies of anti-racism and anti-imperialism. As a capstone project, students will create virtual performances.

Putting aside for a moment the very reasonable doubts about how justified this perception actually was, it is still worth asking, how did people who lived in the world in which differences in rank, class, gender or ethnicity were not supposed to matter, make sense of their postsocialist condition, one in which new forms of difference emerged, and old ones assumed greater prominence? And how do these encounters with difference impact current events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the persistent tensions between East and West Germans? This tutorial will examine new dilemmas through ethnographic studies and documentary films that aim to capture in real time the process of articulating and grappling with newly discovered divides. We will focus especially closely on Russia, but will also read studies on East Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine. This course fulfills the DPE requirement by exploring comparatively the ways in which people in different countries made sense of the social, cultural and political heterogeneity of the postsocialist condition.",

Readings include ethnographic accounts of sanitation labor and social hierarchy; studies of the political and environmental consequences of systems of waste management in the colonial period and the present; and theoretical inquiries into the relation between filth and culture, including work by Mary Douglas, Dipesh Chakrabarty and Karl Marx. Geographically the foci are South Asia, Japan, and the United States. There is also a fieldwork component to the course.

The contemporary moment calls on us to revisit this assumption. This course explores the causes and consequences of democratic erosion through the lens of comparative politics. We ask three central questions to inform our investigation: 1) What is democracy and its alternatives? 2) How do we identify democratic breakdown? and 3) What are strategies to counteract backsliding when it occurs? Importantly, this course is \u003cI\u003enot\u003c/I\u003e intended as a partisan critique of any particular American politician or political party. Rather, it is designed to provide an opportunity to engage, critically and carefully, with claims about the state of democracy in the US and elsewhere; to evaluate whether those claims are valid; and, if they are, to consider strategies for mitigating the risk of democratic erosion here and abroad. Readings draw from academic scholarship, media commentary, and current events as they unfold. We will address both empirical and normative dimensions of the issues, as well as learn about examples of democratic erosion around the world from early 20th century until today. As a collaborative class taught at dozens of other colleges, the course enables you to engage in debates about democratic erosion with students throughout the US and around the world.",

Gandhi is well known today for his philosophy of non-violent resistance and its application in India's freedom struggle as well as his influence on the work of leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. Hailed as the 'father of the Indian nation', however, Gandhi is not only known for his political ideas but also for his deep engagement with aspect of everyday human behavior and morality: truth, vegetarianism, sex and celibacy, to name just a few of his obsessions which contributed to making his broader philosophy. It is this commitment to a morally pure life that earned him the title of 'Mahatma' or Great Soul in India. This tutorial will focus on three key aspects of Gandhi: his ideas of peaceful protest as means of social and political change, his contemplations on moral philosophy, and on his legacy in modern India and the world. Students will read a combination of Gandhi's own writings as well as journal articles, monographs and films. The course will probe questions such as: What was the context and nature of Gandhian nationalism? Did it help to integrate the Indian nation? Was Gandhi truly a Great Soul, a saint or a shrewd politician? In what ways is Gandhi received and remembered by the Indian nation today? How does understanding a figure like Gandhi facilitate our understanding of modern nationalism, citizenship and political action?",

This course takes these questions as starting points in exploring the concept of architectural sustainability, defined as \"minimizing the negative impact of built form on the surrounding landscape,\" and how this concept can be interpreted not only from an environmental point of view, but from cultural, political, and social perspectives as well. Over the course of the class, students will explore different conceptualizations of sustainability and how these conceptualizations take form in built environments in response to the cultural identities, political agendas, social norms, gender roles, and religious values circulating in society at any given moment. In recognizing the relationship between the way things are constructed (technique of assembly, technology, materials, process) and the deeper meanings behind the structural languages deployed, students will come to understand sustainability as a fundamentally context-specific ideal, and its manifestation within the architectural environment as a mode of producing dialogues about the anticipated futures of both cultural and architectural worlds.",

Ultimately, we will develop an understanding of the consequences of climate change that connects physical processes with the geography of place. Specific topics include foundations of the Earth system, plate tectonics and the construction of landscapes, Earth materials, rivers and flooding, hillslope processes, coastal processes, and climate impacts on natural resources such as fresh water and soil. Labs will use local field sites and analytical exercises to evaluate recent cases that reflect an interaction of the landscape and climate.

      "descriptionSearch": "Plate tectonic theory accounts for the vast majority of volcanic islands in ocean basins. They form above mantle plume hot spots (Hawaiian and Galapagos Islands), subduction zones (Aleutian and Indonesian arcs), and mid-ocean ridges (Azores and Ascension Island). Iceland is unusual because it is located above a hot spot and the mid-Atlantic ridge. Each plate tectonic setting produces chemically distinctive magmas, and the lifespan of volcanic islands varies widely. Islands above hot spots may be geographically remote and emergent for only several million years, but be part of a long-lived sequence of islands that persists for over a hundred million years. In contrast, island arc volcanoes belong to long geographically continuous chains of volcanoes, commonly in close proximity to continents. This tutorial explores the geologic evolution and lifespan of volcanic islands from formation to submergence, and searches for correlations between these characteristics and plate tectonic setting. We will also consider how geographic isolation, areal extent, lifespan, and climate affect biological evolution on volcanic islands.There will be weekly tutorial meetings with pairs of students, and students will alternate writing papers on assigned topics.

      "descriptionSearch": "Former President Barack Obama once said: \"There's one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent threat of a changing climate.\" While consensus regarding the causes and impacts of climate change has been growing steadily among scientists and researchers (and to some extent, the general public) over the past two decades, the U.S. has yet to confront this issue in a manner consistent with its urgency. This lack of action in the U.S. is at least partly due to the fact that science provides necessary but insufficient information towards crafting effective climate change legislation and the unfortunate fact that climate change has become a highly partisan issue. The primary objective of this tutorial will be to help students develop a greater understanding of the difficulties associated with crafting climate change legislation, with an emphasis on the role of science and politics within the legislative process. To this end, the tutorial will address how the underlying scientific complexities embedded in most climate policies (e.g., offsets, carbon capture and sequestration, uncertainty and complexity of the climate system, leakage) must be balanced by and blended with the different operational value systems (e.g., economic, social, cultural, religious) that underlie U.S. politics. Over the course of this tutorial, students will develop a nuanced sense of how and when science can support the development of comprehensive national climate change legislation within the current partisan climate. This course will take a practical approach, where students will craft weekly policy oriented documents (e.g., policy memos, action memos, research briefs) targeted to selected members of the current U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the committee that has historically held jurisdiction over a majority of the major climate change bills that have moved through the legislative process.

Many are located on active volcanoes, especially at mid-ocean ridges, where magma super-heats water to form underwater hot springs. Others are located at deep-sea fracture zones, where the exothermic reaction of serpentinization provides the heat to drive hydrothermal circulation. Hydrothermal vents are extreme environments which host unique organisms, like giant tubeworms and giant hydrothermal clams, that are found only at these deep sea oases. This tutorial will examine how and where hydrothermal vents form, the strange and ancient life there, and why they are relevant despite feeling so far removed from our daily lives. Hydrothermal vent science draws on geology, physics, chemistry, and biology, so prior interest or coursework in one or more of those fields is suggested.

Access to innovative technological, scientific, financial and legal resources is controlled by policy makers. Equal access is critical for the sustainability of our coastal communities. But fair decisions require vulnerable communities to have a voice in local climate change adaptation decisions. This seminar course will introduce you to basic concepts of climate justice in the context of our Nation's coastal communities, guided by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The course will introduce you to fundamental coastal and ocean-based climate-induced impacts with a focus on sea level rise, ocean warming, ocean acidification and coastal infrastructure. We will examine these impacts, as well as local, state, regional and federal policy responses to them through the lens of climate justice. We will identify what's working and what more needs to be done to advance climate equity and justice in the wake of formidable global and local change. Proficiency will be demonstrated through class participation, work conducted in small group strategy exercises, discussion board posts, short research assessment papers and a final written project. There are three goals in this course: first to broaden your understanding of the disproportionate effects of climate change to underrepresented, disempowered, poor, urban and indigenous populations living in American coastal communities; second to provide you with tools to identify inequity; third, to increase your own voice to promote avenues to seek climate justice.",

      "descriptionSearch": "This First Year tutorial, available in English, investigates the mutual mistrust between the two Germanies in the Cold War period up until the peaceful popular protests that brought down the Berlin Wall. The political tensions between communist East Germany, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and its capitalist Western counterpart, the Federal Republic (FRG), created a fascinating culture of governmental spying, but also led to aggravated periods of state surveillance of its own citizens. How were families affected across generations by these divisive politics, including the two states' differing treatment of the Nazi legacy? What was the involvement of the KGB and the CIA? How did East German intelligence try to destabilize the West from inside? Which locations in Berlin served as centers for spying, given that the city's terrain is quite flat and exposed? High-profile cases of conflicting loyalties include the Guillaume spy affair that brought down Willy Brandt as Chancellor of the FRG in 1974, and the Brasch family in the GDR, where the father, a communist true believer, turned his three sons over to the Stasi for their dissident activism and engaged art. We will debate filmic treatments of the recruitment of spies as double agents (\u003cI\u003eCoded Message for the Boss\u003c/I\u003e, 1979), the chilling effects of police surveillance during the Baader-Meinhof radical left terrorist attacks (\u003cI\u003eThe Lost Honor of Katharina Blum\u003c/I\u003e, 1975; \u003cI\u003eKnife in the Head\u003c/I\u003e, 1978) the afterlives of former terrorists who were offered new identities as 'ordinary' East Germans (\u003cI\u003eThe legend of Rita\u003c/I\u003e, 2000), to the effects of the Stasi files becoming accessible to their victims after the fall of the wall (\u003cI\u003eEs ist nicht vorbei, Anderson\u003c/I\u003e). We will also discuss popular film representations of spying in \u003cI\u003eLives of Others\u003c/I\u003e (2007) and \u003cI\u003eBridge of Spies\u003c/I\u003e (2015), and selected episodes from the popular TV-series \u003cI\u003eGermany 83 and 86\u003c/I\u003e (2018). Literature will likely include: Thomas Brasch, \u003cI\u003eThe Sons Die Before the Fathers\u003c/I\u003e (1977), Christa Wolf, \u003cI\u003eWhat Remains\u003c/I\u003e (1993), Monika Maron, \u003cI\u003eFlight of Ashes\u003c/I\u003e (1981), Heinrich Böll, \u003cI\u003eThe Lost Honour of Katharina Blum\u003c/I\u003e (1974).

But close examination of Franz Kafka's work and life reveals a multi-dimensional world that goes far beyond the cliché. Jewish in an increasingly anti-Semitic environment, German-speaking surrounded by Czech-speakers, deeply alone in a family that didn't understand him, Kafka produced texts that simultaneously demand and refuse to be interpreted. In this tutorial we will begin with intensive readings of selected short stories and parables, then move on to an exploration of the social, political, and intellectual context in which Kafka worked. The course will conclude with discussions of how both texts and context might be linked to our own contemporary conditions. This will be a modified tutorial, with five groups of three students apiece. Students may take the tutorial in either German or English; groups will be formed accordingly.",

Yet the armistice that brought hostilities on the Western front to a close on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918, did not have the same significance for Eastern Europe and the Middle East, where revolutions and civil wars continued to be fought well into 1923. Ultimately, the Great War toppled four empires (German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman) and forcibly displaced and killed millions of civilians (including Armenians and Jews), creating new countries and colonies throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This tutorial will explore the global history of the First World War, a history that is indispensable for understanding the world of today. We will consider a broad range of topics and sources in our examination of the political, social, cultural, economic, and military histories of the Great War and its aftermath.",

      "descriptionSearch": "Long before the US and its allies fought the recent war in Afghanistan (2001; ongoing), Britain fought three Afghan Wars. Now almost forgotten, dusty reminders of Britain's imperial past, they were crucial moments in the \"Great Game\", the rivalry between the British and Russian empires for supremacy in Central Asia and control of land routes to British India. Largely disastrous for the British, the First Afghan War (1839-1842) resulted in the tragic deaths of some 16,000 individuals, the Second (1878-1881) generated considerable domestic discord, and the Third (1919) basically ended British influence in Afghan affairs. Nevertheless, they exercised the Victorian imagination and led to numerous cultural productions that will be dissected in our class: illustrated tales of British military exploits proliferated in the press; the children's writer G.A. Henty turned the conflicts into the stuff of imperial adventure; Rudyard Kipling made the Great Game the backdrop for several works of fiction; military officers, government officials, \"lady travelers\", and amateur scholars all mapped the landscape and people of Afghanistan, an endless source of fascination for the Victorians. By interpreting these various forms of documentary evidence, we will not only reconstruct the history of the wars Britain fought in Afghanistan, and the reasons for them, but dissect the stories Britons told themselves about their Empire and about Afghanistan and its people.",

How would we choose to define the very term, \"manifesto?\" Why have so many radical American writings been embraced as having the characteristics of a manifesto? We'll look at these questions through close readings and analyses of manifestos across three different historical junctures in the U.S. -- the Revolutionary era, the 1830s and 1840s, and the 1960s and early 1970s -- focusing in particular on struggles over racial equality and women's rights.",

      "descriptionSearch": "This history tutorial utilizes popular film as a vehicle to explore American Cold War culture. The Cold War was an intense period of political, ideological, cultural, and military struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union that took place after the Second World War. For every nuclear test, arms sale, or military operation, there was a propaganda ploy, rhetorical barb, or diplomatic ultimatum to match. Amidst this hostile competition between two incompatible ways of life--communism and capitalism; totalitarianism and democracy--an atmosphere marked by panic, secrecy, insecurity, paranoia, surveillance, and conformity pervaded American life. Given the vast cultural influence of movies, film during this era served as a vital ideological battleground. Moreover, cinema offers us a window into the cultural landscape of Cold War America, for film reflects, interprets, and shapes national identity in complex ways. The films examined in this course (for the most part, Hollywood productions from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s) serve as unique historical documents and as cultural texts illuminating the ways filmmakers and audiences negotiated the challenges presented by the Cold War struggle. The films assigned for this course focus on a range of topics, including anticommunism, competing visions of Americanism, religion, the Hollywood Ten, J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, the nuclear arms race, brainwashing, gender, race relations, and the eventual unravelling of the Cold War consensus. The historical analysis of film requires not only a close reading of the movies themselves, but also a clear understanding of the historical context in which they appeared. The readings paired with each film will help to clarify this context and offer interpretations of the films with which we will engage.",

Beginning with the diverse Indigenous societies that inhabited the Americas millennia before Columbus's arrival, it discusses the cultural complexity of Native peoples, nations, and worldviews rooted in particular ecosystems and homelands, as well as accounts of beginnings and migrations. It addresses how Native peoples confronted grievous epidemics resulting from the \"Columbian Exchange,\" and contended with Euro-colonial projects of \"discovery\" and colonization. Indigenous nations' multifaceted efforts to maintain sovereignty and lands through eras of pervasive violence and removal are discussed, as well as the important yet under-recognized ways that Native communities negotiated the tumultuous era and conflicting allegiances of the Civil War. The course centers on Indigenous actors-intellectuals, diplomats, legal strategists, knowledge keepers, spiritual leaders, artists, and others-and consistently connects historical events with present-day debates over land, historical memory, education, and activism. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to engage with original materials pertaining to Native histories in the Williams College Archives/Special Collections and Art Museum.

Are you curious why black-eyed peas and collards are considered \"soul food\"? In this course, we will answer these questions by digging in to the histories of global environmental transformation through colonialism, slavery, and international migration. We will consider the production and consumption of food as a locus of power over the last 300 years. Beginning with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade and continuing through the 20th century, we trace the global movement of plants, foods, flavors, workers, businesses, and agricultural knowledge. Major units include rice production by enslaved people in the Americas; Asian American food histories during the Cold War; and fat studies critiques of obesity discourse. We will discuss food justice, food sovereignty, and contemporary movements for food sustainability in the context of these histories and our contemporary world. Readings are interdisciplinary, but our emphasis will be on historical analyses of race, labor, environment, health, and gender.",

In 1898 the United States annexed Puerto Rico and has retained sovereignty to this day. These early conquests and continuing im/migrations created Mexican and Puerto Rican communities in the United States. U.S. imperialism continued to shape the im/migrations that created Cuban, Dominican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and other Latinx communities in the United States. This course explores U.S. military, political, and economic interventions and their impact on im/migrations and the making of Latinx communities. We also explore the impact of U.S. employers' and the U.S. government's recruitment of low wage workers in shaping im/migrations, destinations, and the formation of Latinx working-class communities. Im/migration and refugee policies have long defined who is eligible to enter and how, as well as who is deemed eligible for citizenship and belonging. Within this context, Latinas and Latinos have developed survival and family reunification strategies for themselves, their families, and their communities.",

We will ask how historians might engage with those outside of academe; what moral and political responsibilities historians should assume; how history is related to memory making; and why history education has been so contentious.

By placing queer sexualities in their broader social and political context, the course examines the ways in which sexuality has become central to questions of identity, both personal and national, in modern European society. Topics include: ways of thinking about the queer past; women's \"friendships\" in Victorian Britain; the role of the new science of sexology in specifying various \"sexual perversions\"; the rise of sexual undergrounds in the context of European urbanization; the birth of campaigns for \"homosexual emancipation\"; attempts to regulate and suppress \"deviant\" sexualities, especially under the fascist and Nazi regimes in the 1930s; the effects of the postwar consumer revolution on the practices of sexual selfhood; the postwar \"sex change\" debates; the politics of 1950s homophile organizing and the 1970s Gay Liberation Movement; and recent debates about migrant queer identities in an increasingly multicultural Europe. The course will focus primarily on experiences in Britain, France, and Germany, but with some detours to Italy and Russia. Readings will be drawn from sexological texts, political tracts, memoirs, and the writings of recent historians and theorists. Several films will be screened and will also be central to our discussions of the changing meanings of sexual selfhood in modern European societies.",

      "descriptionSearch": "On Christmas Day 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev ended two things: his tenure as President of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union itself. In the years that followed, the Soviet Union's fifteen national republics splintered overnight into more than a dozen nation states along uneven and highly contest ethnic lines. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin assumed office as the first president of the Russian Federation, and without delay, began to institute radical economic and social reforms. Under his watch, the country privatized national industry, cut the state budget, and courted foreign multinational businesses. The world most commonly used to describe Russia in the early 1990s is \"disappear\": money, jobs, food, and people. The very things that Soviet-style socialism had committed itself to providing for started to vanish as a result of invisible and market forces. Russian nationalism replaced Soviet internationalism as a guiding national idea. This course will explore what emerged in the spaces left empty after Soviet-style socialism's demise in three parts. The first part of the semester will examine the origins of the Soviet Union's collapse and its breakup into fifteen successor states. The second part of the semester will survey the political, economic, and social processes that followed the collapse. Finally, the third part of the course will focus on Putin's ascendancy to the presidency and its consequences for Russian citizens at home and Russia's image abroad. Three themes will occupy a prominent place in the course: political-economy, nationalism, and identity. By semester's end, students will have acquired the content and analytical literacy to place the former Soviet Union in its specific historical context and identify multiple sources of causation that may help explain Russia's transition from socialism to capitalism to Putinism during the past quarter century.",

It will cover such topics as: utopian communes; the political economy of slavery; working-class religion and labor organizing; Christian and Jewish socialism; big business and the Prosperity Gospel; 'New Age' spirituality and the counterculture; and conservative Christianity in the age of Wal-Mart and Chick-Fil-A.",

The class will investigate the role of the nuclear arms race in the Cold War, the consequences of nuclear production on specific communities, and the implications of the atomic age on our critical understanding of technological innovation more generally. We will also consider the saliency of competing narratives interpreting America's decision (and continuing policies) to build, use, and stockpile nuclear weapons. Employing both sociological and historical perspectives, we will explore the interactions between science, politics, and culture in the nuclear age.",

Ideologies of race factored heavily into the nineteenth century process by which the United States expanded its territorial control across the North American continent and established an empire of its own. Racialized thinking persisted at the heart of U.S. foreign relations in the twentieth century, influencing everything from the administration of empire in the Caribbean and the Pacific and commercial expansion into central America to the decision to use nuclear weapons against Japan, the diplomatic path to war in Vietnam, and more. The defeat of fascism and Nazism in World War II posed serious challenges to the premises of white supremacy, while ushering in a Cold War that would become inextricably bound with the process of decolonization. American diplomats were forced to recon with the challenges domestic racism posed to their foreign policy goals, while black internationalists became increasingly involved with global struggles for liberation and equality. While the global color line grew more hotly contested, white supremacist thinking proved as enduring as it was mutable. This upper division tutorial surveys leading scholarship on a range of topics that centers race as a category for understanding American foreign relations.",

In such narratives, the selective utilization of archaeology and ancient history often serves important functions in articulating a conscious and deliberate national history. Thus, in nationalist renderings, archaeological sites and artifacts are not merely relics of the past; they can also be potent and conspicuous symbols of national identity for the modern nation-state. In the Middle East, with its rich archaeological heritage, the relationship among politics, nationalism, and archeology has been particularly strong and interesting. This tutorial addresses the powerful nexus between history and nationalism with a special emphasis on the Middle East. It will explore the battle over who controls history and the \"stuff\" of history such as antiquities, land, heritage sites, and museum exhibitions and how that control has expressed itself in several Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, and Iran. Furthermore, it will discuss how archaeology entered the political discourse, the ethics of repatriation and appropriation, and archaeology's role in contested terrains and political disputes.",

At the broadest level, they profoundly altered spatial residential geography (especially in terms of race), consumer expectations and behavior, governmental policies, cultural norms and assumptions, societal connections, and Americans' relationship to nature. More specifically, the different waves of post-World War II suburban development have both reflected large-scale shifts in how power and money have operated in the American political economy; and set in motion deep-seated changes in electoral politics, in Americans' understandings of how their income should be used, and in how the built landscape should be re-imagined. This tutorial will explore the rich historical literature that has emerged over the last twenty years to provide students with a history of the suburbs, to see the suburbs as more than simply collections of houses that drew individual homeowners who wanted to leave urban areas.  We will focus most of our attention on the period from 1945 through the 1980s.  Some of the questions we will consider will include:  how did the first wave of suburban development bring together postwar racial and Cold War ideologies? Is it possible, as one historian has argued, that suburbs actually created the environmental movement of the 1960s? And how have historians understood the role that suburbs played in America's conservative political turn, leading to the election of Ronald Reagan?",

Gandhi is well known today for his philosophy of non-violent resistance and its application in India's freedom struggle as well as his influence on the work of leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. Hailed as the 'father of the Indian nation', however, Gandhi is not only known for his political ideas but also for his deep engagement with aspect of everyday human behavior and morality: truth, vegetarianism, sex and celibacy, to name just a few of his obsessions which contributed to making his broader philosophy. It is this commitment to a morally pure life that earned him the title of 'Mahatma' or Great Soul in India. This tutorial will focus on three key aspects of Gandhi: his ideas of peaceful protest as means of social and political change, his contemplations on moral philosophy, and on his legacy in modern India and the world. Students will read a combination of Gandhi's own writings as well as journal articles, monographs and films. The course will probe questions such as: What was the context and nature of Gandhian nationalism? Did it help to integrate the Indian nation? Was Gandhi truly a Great Soul, a saint or a shrewd politician? In what ways is Gandhi received and remembered by the Indian nation today? How does understanding a figure like Gandhi facilitate our understanding of modern nationalism, citizenship and political action?",

A radically interdisciplinary field of inquiry, the roots of STS stretch through the philosophy, history, and sociology/anthropology of science and technology.  Students will become acquainted with major STS schools, methodological strategies and research trajectories through intensive reading and analysis of classical and contemporary works in the field. Considerable attention will be devoted to exploring the nature of science and technology, their relationships to and interactions with one another, society and the natural world, and the influences these interactions exert in shaping what humans value. A fundamental goal of the course is to cultivate awareness and understanding of the social organization of technology and scientific knowledge production, and the technoscientific structuring of modern social life broadly. The course as such is aimed at attracting from all divisions those students who are intellectually adventurous and inclined to think critically about the place and prominence of science and technology in the modern world.",

To that end, we will consider the ties of transhumanism to eugenics and massive investments in pharmaceuticals, anti-aging medicine, and so-called \"GNR\" technologies (i.e. genetics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence and robotics); the movement's affinities with neoliberalism and what some have pointed to as transhumanism's racialized subtext of whiteness. We will furthermore devote considerable attention to the technological singularity, the figure of the cyborg, mind-uploading, space colonization, and cryonic suspension, all of which, like transhumanism broadly, suggest that science and technology have in some sense come to operate as powerful channeling agents for the very sorts of beliefs, practices, and forms of association that theorists of secularization expected modernity to displace. Lastly, throughout the course of the seminar we will take transhumanism as a provocation to think broadly and seriously about religion, technology, embodiment, and ways of being human.",

Amar recasts the debate over whether America has a \"living Constitution,\" a debate usually revolving around whether change in constitutional meaning requires resort to the formal amendment process or can be achieved through judicial interpretation. Amar supports the latter view, but proposes something far-reaching: history itself effectively amends the Constitution. Thus, for example, he argues that speeches by Martin Luther King and precedents set by George Washington, as well as the daily activities and assumptions of ordinary Americans, have become constitutional subtext requiring consideration when we interpret the Constitution. Is that notion convincing? Preposterous? A healthy way of understanding the inevitable intersection of law, history, and politics? A transparent excuse to read one's own views into the Constitution? Through a careful reading of Amar, and other important constitutional theorists, we will probe different ways of thinking about the supreme law of the land.",

These are only a few of the fascinating questions that ancient readers and interpreters of the Book of Genesis asked and attempted to answer. The first ten chapters of Genesis present a tantalizingly brief narrative account of the earliest history of humankind. The text moves swiftly from the Creation to the Flood and its immediate aftermath, but this masterful economy of style leaves many details unexplained. This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions associated with the primeval history in the Genesis. Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to some continuations of these variant traditions in medieval literature, with particular attention to the material on the figures of Cain and Noah. \u003cI\u003eAll readings are in translation.\u003c/I\u003e",

However, the creation of the Alliance Israelite Universelle's schools (1830s), the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the decolonization process in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War accelerated the departure of Arab and Berber Jews from their homelands to other destinations, including France, Israel, Canada, the United States, and different Latin American countries. Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly. The course will help students understand the depth of Jewish life in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and interrogate the local and global factors that led to their disappearance from both social and cultural memories for a long time. Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world. Resisting both conflict and nostalgia as the primary determinants of Jewish-Muslim relations, the course will help students think about multiple ways in which Jews and Muslims formed communities of citizens despite their differences and disagreements.",

We then examine the impact of (im)migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States, as we compare each group's unique history, settlement patterns, and transnational activity. Identity is also a contested terrain. As immigrants and migrants arrive, the United States' policymakers, the media, and others seek to define the \"newcomers\" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time, Latinas/os rearticulate, live, assert, and express their own sense of identity. In this light, we conclude the course with an exploration of these diverse expressions as they relate to questions of class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and national origins.",

U.S. imperialism continued to shape the im/migrations that created Cuban, Dominican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and other Latinx communities in the United States. This course explores U.S. military, political, and economic interventions and their impact on im/migrations and the making of Latinx communities. We also explore the impact of U.S. employers' and the U.S. government's recruitment of low wage workers in shaping im/migrations, destinations, and the formation of Latinx working-class communities. Im/migration and refugee policies have long defined who is eligible to enter and how, as well as who is deemed eligible for citizenship and belonging.

How do Latinas understand and negotiate an imperialist and colonial past of violence and deterritorialization?  How do Latinas/os feel when they historicize citizenship and discover hidden archival scripts documenting how their ancestors' land was stolen, or how they were forced to migrate in response to military interventions or invasions that caused economic devastation and death? In this course students will critically think about past and present everyday performances and transactions of citizenship, its many embodiments, and structures of feeling. Most important, students will embark on a theoretical journey of research and readings to make sense of how citizenship is experienced and felt and how it is historically situated en el aquí y ahora. Students will explore, within an interdisciplinary perspective and a critical cultural studies framework, the many forms of citizenship, including sexual citizenship, intimate citizenship, economic citizenship, diasporic citizenship, transnational citizenship, academic citizenship and others.",

We will focus on a series of recent exhibitions organized as part of a Getty initiative entitled Pacific Standard Time. Diverse in scope, these shows explored important developments in postwar art in California, including feminist art, African American assemblage, Chicano collectives, Modernist architecture, craft, and queer activism.  In this seminar, we will pursue research projects directly related to the art exhibitions we study, and examine southern California conceptualism, photography, performance, painting, sculpture (including assemblage and installation), and video by artists both canonical and lesser known.  Student projects will analyze the critical responses to the exhibitions, while also exploring the roles of archives, art criticism, and curatorial practice in contemporary art history.",

What functions does leadership fill, and what challenges do leaders face, in modern democratic states? The second half of the course will look at leaders in action, charting the efforts of politicians, intellectuals, and grassroots activists to shape the worlds in which they live. Case studies will include antislavery politics and the American Civil War; the global crises of the 1930s and 1940s; and the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to active class participation, students will be expected to write a 5-page proposal for a research paper on a leader of their choice, a 10-page research paper, an in-class midterm exam, and a cumulative, in-class final exam.",

      "descriptionSearch": "Former President Barack Obama once said: \"There's one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent threat of a changing climate.\" While consensus regarding the causes and impacts of climate change has been growing steadily among scientists and researchers (and to some extent, the general public) over the past two decades, the U.S. has yet to confront this issue in a manner consistent with its urgency. This lack of action in the U.S. is at least partly due to the fact that science provides necessary but insufficient information towards crafting effective climate change legislation and the unfortunate fact that climate change has become a highly partisan issue. The primary objective of this tutorial will be to help students develop a greater understanding of the difficulties associated with crafting climate change legislation, with an emphasis on the role of science and politics within the legislative process. To this end, the tutorial will address how the underlying scientific complexities embedded in most climate policies (e.g., offsets, carbon capture and sequestration, uncertainty and complexity of the climate system, leakage) must be balanced by and blended with the different operational value systems (e.g., economic, social, cultural, religious) that underlie U.S. politics. Over the course of this tutorial, students will develop a nuanced sense of how and when science can support the development of comprehensive national climate change legislation within the current partisan climate. This course will take a practical approach, where students will craft weekly policy oriented documents (e.g., policy memos, action memos, research briefs) targeted to selected members of the current U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the committee that has historically held jurisdiction over a majority of the major climate change bills that have moved through the legislative process. This course is in the Oceans and Climate group for the Geosciences major.",

The goal of these discussions is to generate debates over the conceptual, historical, and policy significance of the subjects that we cover. Specifically, the first section of the course will cover the emergence of the Persian Gulf as an area of strategic importance in international politics; U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia and Iran after World War II; the origins of the Arab-Israeli dispute; the June 1967 and October 1973 Middle East conflicts; Egyptian-Israeli peace; the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War; the 1991 Persian Gulf War and its consequences; and the rise of Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas. The second part of the course focuses on the Iraq War and its consequences; the rise of ISIS; the Arab Spring; Turkey's changing foreign relations; and the war in Syria.

We will consider their lives and works, especially as represented by original copies of their books and other publications. These great astronomers include: 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus (heliocentric universe); Tycho Brahe (best pre-telescopic observations); 17th century, Galileo (discoveries with his first astronomical telescope, 1610; sunspots, 1613; \u003cI\u003eDialogo\u003c/I\u003e, 1632); Johannes Kepler (laws of planetary motion, 1609, 1619); Johannes Hevelius and Elisabeth Hevelius (atlases of the Moon and of stars, 1647, and 1687); Isaac Newton (laws of universal gravitation and of motion, 1687); 18th century, Edmond Halley (\u003cI\u003eMiscellanea curiosa\u003c/I\u003e, eclipse maps, 1715, 1724); John Flamsteed and Margaret Flamsteed (\u003cI\u003eAtlas Coelestis\u003c/I\u003e, 1729); and William Herschel and Caroline Herschel (1781, 1798). Also, from more recent times in which original works are often articles rather than books: 20th century, Albert Einstein (special relativity, 1905; general relativity, 1916); Marie Curie (radioactivity); Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (hydrogen dominating stars, 1929), Edwin Hubble (Hubble's law, 1929); Vera Rubin (dark matter, 1970s); Jocelyn Bell Burnell (pulsar discovery, 1968); and 21st century: Wendy Freedman (Universe's expansion rate, 2000s). First editions will be available in Williams's Chapin Library of rare books, and facsimiles or digital copies will be provided for remote learning. We will also consider how such original materials are collected and preserved, and look at examples from the wider world of rarities, such as a leaf from the \u003cI\u003eGutenberg Bible\u003c/I\u003e (c. 1450) and a Shakespeare \u003cI\u003eFirst Folio\u003c/I\u003e (1623, with a discussion of astronomical references in Shakespeare's plays). We evaluate a trove of books and papers about historic transits of Venus. We discuss matters of fraud and authenticity, especially the case of a purported \u003cI\u003eSidereus Nuncius\u003c/I\u003e, shown to be a modern construction. The course will be taught in collaboration between an astronomer and a rare books librarian, with remote lectures by experts from around the world.",

It also introduces foundational methodologies in Native American and Indigenous Studies and strategies for pursuing decolonizing scholarship and action. Beginning with the diverse Indigenous societies that inhabited the Americas millennia before Columbus's arrival, it discusses the cultural complexity of Native peoples, nations, and worldviews rooted in particular ecosystems and homelands, as well as accounts of beginnings and migrations. It addresses how Native peoples confronted grievous epidemics resulting from the \"Columbian Exchange,\" and contended with Euro-colonial projects of \"discovery\" and colonization. Indigenous nations' multifaceted efforts to maintain sovereignty and lands through eras of pervasive violence and removal are discussed, as well as the important yet under-recognized ways that Native communities negotiated the tumultuous era and conflicting allegiances of the Civil War. The course centers on Indigenous actors-intellectuals, diplomats, legal strategists, knowledge keepers, spiritual leaders, artists, and others-and consistently connects historical events with present-day debates over land, historical memory, education, and activism. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to engage with original materials pertaining to Native histories in the Williams College Archives/Special Collections and Art Museum. While the scope of the course is continental and transoceanic, it devotes significant attention to the Native Northeast and the particular Indigenous homelands in which Williams College is located.",

      "descriptionSearch": "The phrase \"conspiracy theory\" typically evokes images of paranoid cranks--of cars plastered with vituperative bumper-stickers and of people who wear tin-foil hats. To be sure, the claims that conspiracy theorists advance can be astonishing, from Pizzagate--alleging that Democratic Party officials ran a human trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant--to the Flat Earth movement, which holds that the earth is, indeed, flat. At the same time, the persistence and power of conspiracy theories in American politics should provoke us to wonder why such preposterous-sounding notions gain traction in the first place, and who benefits from them. That conspiracy theories tend to advance a partisan or ideological view, often intended to discredit a competing movement or ideology, suggests that conspiracy theories can function as a kind of remote leadership--\"leadership\" without any clear leaders at the helm. This course will examine notable American conspiracy theories, such as the Kennedy Assassination theory, \"9/11 Truth,\" and \"Birther-ism,\" in light of recent scholarship on conspiracism, demagoguery, and populism. Our goal will be to understand the political and discursive forces that empower conspiracy theories and the functions they serve in American politics. Where and with whom do conspiracy theories originate? Why do some gain traction while others quickly wither? How can we distinguish between a conspiracy theory based on plausible evidence and one that exists simply to create chaos? And why do some conspiracy theories persist even in the face of direct public refutation?",

Why does Congress not act, especially when the U.S. confronts so many pressing problems, and how do legislators justify inaction?

Gandhi is well known today for his philosophy of non-violent resistance and its application in India's freedom struggle as well as his influence on the work of leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. Hailed as the 'father of the Indian nation', however, Gandhi is not only known for his political ideas but also for his deep engagement with aspect of everyday human behavior and morality: truth, vegetarianism, sex and celibacy, to name just a few of his obsessions which contributed to making his broader philosophy. It is this commitment to a morally pure life that earned him the title of 'Mahatma' or Great Soul in India. This tutorial will focus on three key aspects of Gandhi: his ideas of peaceful protest as means of social and political change, his contemplations on moral philosophy, and on his legacy in modern India and the world. Students will read a combination of Gandhi's own writings as well as journal articles, monographs and films. The course will probe questions such as: What was the context and nature of Gandhian nationalism? Did it help to integrate the Indian nation? Was Gandhi truly a Great Soul, a saint or a shrewd politician? In what ways is Gandhi received and remembered by the Indian nation today? How does understanding a figure like Gandhi facilitate our understanding of modern nationalism, citizenship and political action?",

The structure of the course combines political science concepts and historical case studies, with the goal of generating in-depth classroom debates over key conceptual, historical, and policy questions.

The course will begin--by focusing on the Manhattan Project--with a brief technical overview of nuclear physics, nuclear technologies, and the design and effects of nuclear weapons. The course will then examine the following subjects: the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan; theories of the nuclear revolution; the early Cold War period; the development and implications of thermonuclear weapons; the Berlin and Cuban missile crises; nuclear accidents; nuclear terrorism and illicit nuclear networks; the future of nuclear energy; regional nuclear programs; preventive strikes on nuclear facilities; nuclear proliferation; and contemporary policy debates.",

Many are located on active volcanoes, especially at mid-ocean ridges, where magma super-heats water to form underwater hot springs. Others are located at deep-sea fracture zones, where the exothermic reaction of serpentinization provides the heat to drive hydrothermal circulation. Hydrothermal vents are extreme environments which host unique organisms, like giant tubeworms and giant hydrothermal clams, that are found only at these deep sea oases. This tutorial will examine how and where hydrothermal vents form, the strange and ancient life there, and why they are relevant despite feeling so far removed from our daily lives. Hydrothermal vent science draws on geology, physics, chemistry, and biology, so prior interest or coursework in one or more of those fields is suggested. This course is in the Oceans and Climate group for the Geosciences major.",

Its roles as a cultural symbol, resource, highway, and climate regulator make it essential to life around the world. This interdisciplinary course, team-taught by the faculty of the Williams-Mystic Program, will examine key issues in each of the world's oceans while introducing students to the ways these issues connect multiple disciplines and transcend physical, political, and imaginary ocean boundaries. By drawing on the expertise of the five professors -- from humanities, social sciences, and sciences -- this course facilitates the critical study of the ocean from an interdisciplinary perspective and helps them consider their own role in the shifting relationship between humanity and the ocean. This seminar-style course will meet twice a week online, with students assessed by their participation, response papers, and final project, while helping them apply interdisciplinary skills to pressing sustainability issues connecting the environment and society.",

Corals can thrive in nutrient-poor oceans because of the mutualistic relationship with algal symbionts. And as a foundational species, corals provide a habitat for numerous species, possibly the highest diversity found on the planet. However, these complex and beautiful ecosystems are declining worldwide from a variety of local and global threats. In this course, we will explore coral reef ecology through an in-depth examination of the biotic and abiotic factors contributing to the ecosystem's functioning. We will also investigate the causes and consequences of threats to coral reefs, such as ocean warming, ocean acidification, and resource extraction. Finally, we will identify the many efforts worldwide to conserve coral reefs and promote their resilience. In this seminar course, offered remotely, you will demonstrate your proficiency through knowledge assessments, short writing reflections, a virtual coral fragmentation experiment, and a creative advocacy project. This course aims to deepen your awareness of the complex species interactions on coral reefs and the physical factors affecting coral survival while fostering hope through current conservation efforts.",

Access to innovative technological, scientific, financial and legal resources is controlled by policy makers. Equal access is critical for the sustainability of our coastal communities. But fair decisions require vulnerable communities to have a voice in local climate change adaptation decisions. This seminar course will introduce you to basic concepts of climate justice in the context of our Nation's coastal communities, guided by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The course will introduce you to fundamental coastal and ocean-based climate-induced impacts with a focus on sea level rise, ocean warming, ocean acidification and coastal infrastructure. We will examine these impacts, as well as local, state, regional and federal policy responses to them through the lens of climate justice. We will identify what's working and what more needs to be done to advance climate equity and justice in the wake of formidable global and local change. Proficiency will be demonstrated through class participation, work conducted in small group strategy exercises, discussion board posts, short research assessment papers and a final written project. There are three goals in this course: first to broaden your understanding of the disproportionate effects of climate change to underrepresented, disempowered, poor, urban and indigenous populations living in American coastal communities; second to provide you with tools to identify inequity; third, to increase your own voice to promote avenues to seek climate justice.",

We will also investigate Hilbert spaces, mathematical objects that combine the tidiness of linear algebra with the power of analysis and are fundamental to the study of differential equations, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, and ergodic theory, and also apply to fields like quantum mechanics and machine learning. This material provides good preparation for graduate studies in mathematics, statistics and economics.",

The Kepler Problem (what is the most efficient way to pack balls in three-space) is a good example. The original formulation has been used in such diverse areas as stacking cannonballs on battleships to grocers preparing fruit displays, and its generalizations allow the creation of powerful error detection and correction codes. While the solution of the Kepler Problem is now known, the higher dimensional version is very much open. There has been remarkable progress in the last few years, with number theory playing a key role in these results. We will develop sufficient background material to understand many of these problems and the current state of the field. Pre-requisites are real analysis.",

Through learning about a combination of contemporary styles and longstanding musical traditions spanning a broad geographical range, students will develop a working knowledge of musical terms, concepts, and influential musicians. Beyond engaging with music's sound and structure, we will address its capacity to express personal and group identity, and its ability to both reflect and shape broader social ideas and circumstances. In particular, we will consider music's global circulation, and how its contents and meanings reflect those processes. Genres covered in the course vary intermittently but often include: \"throat singing\" genres in Tuva and Sardinia, Zimbabwean mbira and Chimurenga music, Argentine Tango, Ghanaian azonto and highlife, Balinese gamelan, and North Indian classical music.

      "descriptionSearch": "\"There are only three things that America will be remembered for 200 years from now when they study the civilization: The Constitution, Jazz Music and Baseball. These are the three most beautiful things this culture's ever created.\"--(Gerald Early) Jazz is the most common name for a great African American Art form that still defies definition. Over the past century this elastic tradition has laid down firm roots for numerous other American and World musics, while itself in the throes of a seemingly permanent identity crisis. Jazz is perennially declared dead or dying yet consistently summoned by advertisers to lend vitality and sex appeal to liquor or automobiles. By any name and regardless of its health status, jazz has a rich history of conservative innovators, at once restless and reverent, who made fascinating leaps of creativity out of inspiration or necessity. This \"listening intensive\" class will look at the past century of jazz music through ideas, \"what-if\" questions and movements that changed the way the music was created, presented and perceived. Both musical concepts (such as syncopation and cross instrumental-influence) and cultural connections (racial, technological and economic) will be examined, giving us freedom to link similar kinds of musical thought across disparate settings and decades. Our inquiry will include (but not be limited to) the lives and music of Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, Mary Lou Williams, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, John Lewis, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Wayne Shorter.",

Drawing on the work of critical theorists including Benedict Anderson, Michael Herzfeld, and Ernest Gellner, we will pursue a number of analytical questions: What parallels exist between musical and political structure? How do nations adjust as their policies and demographics change? How are cultural forms implicated in postcolonial nation building projects? What marginal populations or expressive forms are included, excluded, or appropriated in the formation of national identity? Finally, what differences emerge as we change our focus from a national to an international perspective, or from officially endorsed representations of national culture to unofficial popular forms of entertainment?",

Yet precisely because its meanings can be obscure, enabling it to achieve its ends surreptitiously, music has intertwined with danger throughout history. With its power to stir the emotions, stimulate bodily movement, encode messages, and foment rebellion, music has often been perceived as an agent of harm. Plato claimed that too much music could make a man effeminate or neurotic, and warned that certain musical modes, melodies, and rhythms promote licentious behavior and anarchic societies. Puritans, Victorians, and totalitarians, as well as opponents of ragtime, rock 'n roll, and rap, have also accused certain musical genres or styles of exerting dangerous influences, and sought to limit or suppress them. In Afghanistan, the Taliban banned music altogether. While music has often been unfairly accused, its potential for placing people in actual danger is undeniable. Works that are played at ear-splitting decibel levels, that call upon performers to injure themselves, that are used as a form of psychological torture, or that incite violence demand reconsideration of the widely shared view that music is fundamentally a form of entertainment.",

Our focus will be on music's role in Orientalist representation in a wide variety of media and genres, including Hollywood film, television, popular song, music videos, Broadway musicals, hip hop, and novels. We will begin with major texts in cultural theory (Said, Bhabha) and will attempt throughout the semester to revise and refine their tenets. Can American Orientalism be distinguished in any fundamental way from nineteenth-century European imperialist thought? How does Orientalist representation calibrate when the \"exotic others\" being represented are themselves Americans? Our own critical thought will be sharpened through analysis and interpretation of specific works, such as \u003cem\u003eMadame Butterfly,\u003c/em\u003e \"Chinatown, My Chinatown,\" \u003cem\u003eSayonara\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eFlower Drum Song\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMiss Saigon\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRising Sun\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eM.

The exercises will focus on the constraints of sixteenth-century vocal polyphony (music of Palestrina and Lassus) but will illustrate how such contrapuntal discipline is also manifest in music of Corelli, Bach, Brahms and Debussy.",

We will explore these questions using a holistic, integrative approach, considering molecular/cellular mechanisms, physiological characterizations of neurons, and connectivity among brain systems. Journal article discussions will complement course topics, providing experience in reading, understanding, and critiquing primary research papers. Writing an original literature review article will provide experience in expository writing and anonymous peer review. Laboratory sessions will provide experience in examining macroscopic and microscopic neural structures, as well as performing experiments to elucidate the structure and function of neural systems using classical and cutting-edge techniques.",

We doubt, we point out that no one can be certain in what she believes, and we are suspicious of declarations of transcendent reason or truth (unless they are our own). Emboldened by our confidence in skeptical arguments, we claim that knowledge is inevitably limited, that it depends on one's perspective, and that everything one believes is relative to context or culture. No domain of inquiry is immune to this destructive skepticism and confident relativism. Science is only \"true\" for some people, agnosticism is the only alternative to foolish superstition, and moral relativism and, consequently, nihilism are obvious. But is the best conclusion we can come to with respect to our intellectual endeavors that skepticism always carries the day and that nothing at all is true? In this tutorial, we will investigate the nature of skepticism and the varieties of relativism it encourages. Our readings will come primarily from philosophy, but will be supplemented with material from anthropology, physics, psychology, and linguistics. We will look at relativism with respect to reason and truth in general as well as with respect to science, religion, and morality. Along the way, we will need to come to grips with the following surprising fact. With few exceptions, thoroughgoing skepticism and relativism have not been the prevailing views of the greatest minds in the history of philosophy. Were they simply too unsophisticated and confused to understand what is for us the irresistible power of skepticism and relativism? Or might it be that our skepticism and relativism are the result of our own laziness and failure? Of course, this question cannot really be answered, nor is there any value in trying to answer it, and any \"answer\" will only be \"true\" for you. Right?",

By repeated application of the same reasoning, it seems that even after she removes 99,997 grains of sand--I don't know what she wants with all this sand, but I'm starting to worry about that girl--there is still a heap of sand in my backyard. But three grains isn't enough for a heap. So there is not a heap in my backyard. Now I'm confused.

We can learn a lot about logic, language, epistemology and metaphysics by thinking through and attempting to resolve paradoxes. In this class, we'll work together to think through some ancient and contemporary paradoxes. We'll also work on writing lucid prose that displays precisely the logical structure of arguments, engages in focused critique of these arguments, and forcefully presents arguments of our own.

Why then should we spend our time studying people who in addition to having these surprising beliefs have been dead for 2500 years? First of all, Greek thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding of western intellectual history without some familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our understanding of our own situation. More importantly, many of the thinkers that we will read in this class are simply excellent philosophers, and it is worthwhile for anyone interested in philosophical problems to read treatments of these problems by excellent philosophers. We will begin the course by looking briefly at some of the Presocratic philosophers active in the Mediterranean world of the seventh through fifth centuries BCE, and some of the sophists active in the fifth century. We will then turn to several of Plato's dialogues, examining Plato's portrayal of Socrates and his development of a new and profoundly powerful philosophical conception. Finally, we will examine some of Aristotle's works on metaphysics, epistemology and ethics, considering some of the ways Aristotle's thought responds to that of predecessors.",

In this course, we will survey the ethics of public health through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic, investigating concepts and arguments that are central to the ethics of public health research and practice. For example, we will examine the ethics of disease surveillance, treatment and vaccine research, resource allocation and rationing, compulsion and voluntariness in public health measures, and social determinants of health outcomes, among other topics. To do this, we will need to become familiar with key ethical theories; think deeply about such concepts as privacy, paternalism and autonomy, exploitation, cost-benefit analysis and justice; and compare the function of these concepts in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic with the way they work in responses to other public health concerns.",

Existentialists investigate irrational phenomena of human life, including anxiety, boredom, tragedy, despair, meaning, death, faith, sexuality, love, hate, sadism, masochism, and authenticity.

      "descriptionSearch": "In ancient Greece, Democritus took his ontological bearings by atoms he took not to come to be, change, or pass away, but to move and interconnect in space so as to compose everything else. Plato also took his ontological bearings by entities that do not change, but ones that are not in space or time: mathematical structures and, at least aspirationally, the forms or ideas of the good, the beautiful, etc. Aristotle, finally, took his ontological bearings by temporal entities, i.e., organisms. In these terms, modern science combines central teachings of Democritus and Plato: the universe is understood as a mechanism whose components--ultimately, atoms--interact in ways governed by mathematical laws, and--for Descartes and his followers--animals, too, are machines rather than organisms. Hence, Laplace's (1814) thesis that \"An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.\" This deterministic, mechanistic, and reductionist way of thinking has, for the past several hundred years, powerfully influenced such diverse fields as philosophy, biology, and economics. Over the past few decades, however, it has been challenged by new discoveries, particularly in physics and biology, and by theoreticians in a variety of disciplines. These theoreticians focus on complex, dynamic systems as, in one terminology, wholes that are more than the sums of their constituents. In this tutorial, we examine some of the most promising and intriguing trends in this potentially revolutionary movement. Our central focus will be on autopoietic systems, i.e., entities that subsist over time despite changing their material constituents. The smallest such entities are cells, but the tissues, organs, and organisms of which many cells are constituents are also autopoietic systems, as are yet more complex entities such as universities, economies, ecosystems, and states. The process ontology required by autopoietic systems is a radical alternative to the ontology that has been dominant for the past several centuries. It has many exciting implications for various subdisciplines in philosophy and for various academic disciplines beyond philosophy.",

In this course we'll explore justice as a fundamental moral principle and as a desideratum of the US health care system. The first portion of the course will be devoted to considering general theories of justice as well as alternative conceptions of justice specifically within the health care context. While social justice and distributive justice are deeply intertwined in the health care context and we will discuss both, we will focus primarily on the concept of distributive justice. This theoretically oriented work will provide the background for subsequent examination of specific topics, which may include, among others: justice in health care financing and reform; justice in health care rationing and access to health care, with particular attention to the intersections of rationing criteria with gender, sexuality, race, disability, and age; justice in the procurement and allocation of organs for transplantation; obesity and personal responsibility for illness; and justice in medical research, including \"double standards\" for research conducted in low resource settings.",

Are you curious why black-eyed peas and collards are considered \"soul food\"? In this course, we will answer these questions by digging in to the histories of global environmental transformation through colonialism, slavery, and international migration. We will consider the production and consumption of food as a locus of power over the last 300 years. Beginning with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade and continuing through the 20th century, we trace the global movement of plants, foods, flavors, workers, businesses, and agricultural knowledge. Major units include rice production by enslaved people in the Americas; Asian American food histories during the Cold War; and fat studies critiques of obesity discourse. We will discuss food justice, food sovereignty, and contemporary movements for food sustainability in the context of these histories and our contemporary world. Readings are interdisciplinary, but our emphasis will be on historical analyses of race, labor, environment, health, and gender.",

In this capstone course, we will begin by reflecting on student experiential components undertaken and sharing the contributions each discipline brings to public health. Then, by way of an example we will examine how a \"proven\" medical innovation moves into the public health landscape, and how health research from a range of disciplines is critical to that transition. Then, we will review and expand students' tool-kit in public health research methods. We will begin by studying a range of sampling approaches and thinking critically about various public health indicators; followed by some coverage of a subset of quantitative public health methods. This will be complemented by learning a variety of qualitative methods in the lab. This broad- based approach is specifically intended to grow the toolkit of concentrators to think critically about the most appropriate research method or set of methods to best answer a specific public health research question. In lab, students will work in small groups and develop a research question that examines a public health problem in the local community. The research question will be answered through a synthesis of literature as well as primary qualitative data collection and analysis.",

Topics to be covered include basic principles of probability; random variables and distributions; statistical estimation, inference and hypothesis testing; and modeling using multiple regression, with a particular focus on understanding whether and how relationships between variables can be determined to be causal--an essential requirement for effective policy formation.

Political tumult around the globe in recent decades has put elites, and others, on edge as young democracies have collapsed and longer standing ones appear to be stumbling. In the United States, basic stability and democratic expansion have been accompanied by increasing citizen distrust of institutions, growing social divisions, and contestation over basic citizenship rights. The current pandemic, related economic distress, and social protests have only sharpened the precarious state of U.S. democracy. Acute observers have long seen the U.S. as a harbinger of the promise and peril of modern democracies. What is the fate of democracy in the U.S.? What does that portend, if anything, for other democracies, or for the general principle of popular sovereignty--the idea that the people govern themselves? We investigate these and related questions, primarily through active, project-based group research activities, guided by political theory and empirical research in the social sciences.\n\nThis class is extensively hybrid by design; it is largely remote with some in-person sessions. Remote sessions include substantial collaboration with a similarly structured first-year course being taught by a sociologist at the University of North Carolina. Williams and UNC students will work together in small groups and will present their project findings to both classes.",

The first part of the course will examine key theoretical problems that have occupied political thinkers from Plato and Confucius to Machiavelli and the American framers: What makes a leader successful? What kinds of regimes best serve to encourage good leaders and to constrain bad ones? What is the relationship between leadership and morality-can the ends justify the means? What functions does leadership fill, and what challenges do leaders face, in modern democratic states? The second half of the course will look at leaders in action, charting the efforts of politicians, intellectuals, and grassroots activists to shape the worlds in which they live. Case studies will include antislavery politics and the American Civil War; the global crises of the 1930s and 1940s; and the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to active class participation, students will be expected to write a 5-page proposal for a research paper on a leader of their choice, a 10-page research paper, an in-class midterm exam, and a cumulative, in-class final exam.",

Even before the coronavirus pandemic gave us reason to wonder if we are, in fact, living through an apocalypse, speculation about the end of the world and its aftermath pervaded recent television, movies, literature, philosophy, and critical theory. In this class we draw these works into conversation with political theories of the \"state of nature\" and \"state of exception\" to better understand what political possibilities are opened and foreclosed in times of crisis. What aspects of politics will endure the ravages of fire or pestilence? What new political realities might emerge on ground cleared by disaster? What does it say about pre-pandemic politics that we were so eager to consume stories of states falling and bands of survivors scraping together a nasty, brutish and short existence? And how will the unfolding pandemic change how we respond to these stories? Class will be driven primarily by discussion, typically introduced by a brief lecture.",

In this class we will consider a number of analytic concepts central to the study of politics generally--the state, legitimacy, democracy, authoritarianism, nationalism--to comprehend political processes and transformations in various parts of the world. We will focus particularly on three themes: what is democracy and how might it fail?  Why do certain authoritarian regimes persist while others do not?

The purpose is to deepen our understanding of politics. In this class we will consider a number of analytic concepts central to the study of politics generally--the state, legitimacy, democracy, authoritarianism, nationalism--to comprehend political processes and transformations in various parts of the world. We will focus particularly on three themes: what is democracy and how might it fail?  Why do certain authoritarian regimes persist while others do not?  How is national identity shaped by politics, and how is politics, in turn, shaped by nationalism?",

It spells out who can be a sovereign state and how to become one, what states can do, what they cannot do, and who can punish transgressions. It also creates status used by other actors, such as international organizations, soldiers, national liberation movements, refugees, transnational air and sea shipping companies, and multinational corporations. International law is similar to domestic law, with one very crucial difference: it is not in theory enforced by a centralized, sovereign state. In most other respects, it is the same: it protects the status quo, including the distribution of power among its members; it spells out legitimate and illegitimate ways of resolving conflicts of interest; it is biased toward the powerful and legitimates their interests; it tells its members how to act to coordinate their interests and minimize direct conflict; some of it is purely aspirational, some of it necessary for survival. And like domestic law, it is enforced only some of the time, and then against the weak more than the strong. Yet, law is still where we look for justice and, perhaps, the legitimation of order.",

The goal of these discussions is to generate debates over the conceptual, historical, and policy significance of the subjects that we cover. Specifically, the first section of the course will cover the emergence of the Persian Gulf as an area of strategic importance in international politics; U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia and Iran after World War II; the origins of the Arab-Israeli dispute; the June 1967 and October 1973 Middle East conflicts; Egyptian-Israeli peace; the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War; the 1991 Persian Gulf War and its consequences; and the rise of Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas. The second part of the course focuses on the Iraq War and its consequences; the rise of ISIS; the Arab Spring; Turkey's changing foreign relations; and the war in Syria.

And on what grounds can we justify confidence in our provisional answers to such questions? Class will be primarily driven by discussion, often preceded by brief lectures.

Does this mean that we have descended to barbarism? Tracing the path of capitalist development in the rich democracies suggests a range of responses. Some states have developed robust institutions that provide for citizens' basic needs and check the power of business; others leave the poor threatened by starvation and workers exposed to exploitation. How and why has capitalism evolved in different forms in different countries? This course addresses the politics of capitalism by examining the struggles between social groups that lead to variation in distributional outcomes and economic performance. The course concludes by investigating these struggles in light of contemporary challenges, in particular, transnational governance and technological change.",

Access to innovative technological, scientific, financial and legal resources is controlled by policy makers. Equal access is critical for the sustainability of our coastal communities. But fair decisions require vulnerable communities to have a voice in local climate change adaptation decisions. This seminar course will introduce you to basic concepts of climate justice in the context of our Nation's coastal communities, guided by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The course will introduce you to fundamental coastal and ocean-based climate-induced impacts with a focus on sea level rise, ocean warming, ocean acidification and coastal infrastructure. We will examine these impacts, as well as local, state, regional and federal policy responses to them through the lens of climate justice. We will identify what's working and what more needs to be done to advance climate equity and justice in the wake of formidable global and local change. Proficiency will be demonstrated through class participation, work conducted in small group strategy exercises, discussion board posts, short research assessment papers and a final written project. There are three goals in this course: first to broaden your understanding of the disproportionate effects of climate change to underrepresented, disempowered, poor, urban and indigenous populations living in American coastal communities; second to provide you with tools to identify inequity; third, to increase your own voice to promote avenues to seek climate justice.",

      "descriptionSearch": "The phrase \"conspiracy theory\" typically evokes images of paranoid cranks--of cars plastered with vituperative bumper-stickers and of people who wear tin-foil hats. To be sure, the claims that conspiracy theorists advance can be astonishing, from Pizzagate--alleging that Democratic Party officials ran a human trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant--to the Flat Earth movement, which holds that the earth is, indeed, flat. At the same time, the persistence and power of conspiracy theories in American politics should provoke us to wonder why such preposterous-sounding notions gain traction in the first place, and who benefits from them. That conspiracy theories tend to advance a partisan or ideological view, often intended to discredit a competing movement or ideology, suggests that conspiracy theories can function as a kind of remote leadership--\"leadership\" without any clear leaders at the helm. This course will examine notable American conspiracy theories, such as the Kennedy Assassination theory, \"9/11 Truth,\" and \"Birther-ism,\" in light of recent scholarship on conspiracism, demagoguery, and populism. Our goal will be to understand the political and discursive forces that empower conspiracy theories and the functions they serve in American politics. Where and with whom do conspiracy theories originate? Why do some gain traction while others quickly wither? How can we distinguish between a conspiracy theory based on plausible evidence and one that exists simply to create chaos? And why do some conspiracy theories persist even in the face of direct public refutation?",

We do so in four steps by examining (1) the origins of the Silicon Valley model, (2) other countries' attempts to emulate it, (3) what it's like to work in tech, and (4) possibilities for regulating the tech sector. Each step will deepen students' understanding of tech. By engaging multiple analytical lenses, students will develop the tools to articulate the possibilities and imperatives of democratic politics in the twenty-first century.",

Despite this, national government has grown in scope and size for much of this history, including under both Democratic and Republican administrations. This tension over what government is doing and what it should be doing is only heightened in times of crisis, such as the moment the country is in now. This course explores the relationship between citizens and their government by examining the growth of the American state in various arenas over time, as well as the assaults on government legitimacy in recent years. We will assess traditional theories about the weakness of the American state in light of arguments about the state as: regulator of family and \"private\" life, adjudicator of relations between racial and ethnic groups, manager of economic inequalities, insurer of security, and arbiter of the acceptable uses of violence and surveillance.",

The contemporary moment calls on us to revisit this assumption. This course explores the causes and consequences of democratic erosion through the lens of comparative politics. We ask three central questions to inform our investigation: 1) What is democracy and its alternatives? 2) How do we identify democratic breakdown? and 3) What are strategies to counteract backsliding when it occurs? Importantly, this course is \u003cI\u003enot\u003c/I\u003e intended as a partisan critique of any particular American politician or political party. Rather, it is designed to provide an opportunity to engage, critically and carefully, with claims about the state of democracy in the US and elsewhere; to evaluate whether those claims are valid; and, if they are, to consider strategies for mitigating the risk of democratic erosion here and abroad. Readings draw from academic scholarship, media commentary, and current events as they unfold. We will address both empirical and normative dimensions of the issues, as well as learn about examples of democratic erosion around the world from early 20th century until today. As a collaborative class taught at dozens of other colleges, the course enables you to engage in debates about democratic erosion with students throughout the US and around the world.",

What are the social, economic, and political consequences of unprecedented global mobility in both destination countries and countries of origin? This class investigates one of the most polarizing and relevant issues of our time: the politics of migration. Throughout the semester we interrogate four themes central to migration politics: rights, representation, access, and agency. The course is organized with a focus on status: which \"categories\" of people (i.e. citizens, migrants, refugees) have differential access to rights, services, and representation and why. Drawing on political speeches, documentary films, humanitarian campaigns, and a variety of academic texts, we critically analyze how those categories are constructed, as well as the political work they do in making claims, justifying policies, and shaping public opinion. The class situates contemporary US migration policies within a global context and over time, placing the US case in conversation with considerations of migration politics and policies in countries around the world. As an experiential education course, we will (virtually) attend a US naturalization ceremony as well as interview officials from organizations working with migrants and refugees here and abroad.",

They also have produced attempts by both internal and external actors to resolve the issues. This research seminar will engage the origins of the conflicts and the role of identities in them, the role of disputes about sovereign power in creating and intensifying them, the strategies for reconciling them that are adopted domestically and internationally, the deals that have been struck or have not been struck to bring peace in these societies, and the outcomes of the various efforts in their contemporary politics. The course will begin by reading about both the general theoretical issues raised by conflicts in these \"divided societies\" and various responses to them. After familiarizing ourselves with what academic and policy literatures have to say about them, we then will read about the histories and contemporary politics in each society. With that as background, students will choose an aspect or aspects of these conflicts as a subject for their individual research.",

The structure of the course combines political science concepts and historical case studies, with the goal of generating in-depth classroom debates over key conceptual, historical, and policy questions. Classes will be taught remotely. The basic format of the course will be to combine very brief lectures with detailed class discussions of each session's topic. The course will begin--by focusing on the Manhattan Project--with a brief technical overview of nuclear physics, nuclear technologies, and the design and effects of nuclear weapons. The course will then examine the following subjects: the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan; theories of the nuclear revolution; the early Cold War period; the development and implications of thermonuclear weapons; the Berlin and Cuban missile crises; nuclear accidents; nuclear terrorism and illicit nuclear networks; the future of nuclear energy; regional nuclear programs; preventive strikes on nuclear facilities; nuclear proliferation; and contemporary policy debates.",

Is resilience a static trait, or can it be promoted? How do we prevent youth from developing psychopathology? In this course, students will address these and other questions using a risk and resilience framework that examines the interactions among multiple risk and protective factors in the pathway to psychopathology. Specifically, students will examine the interactions between individual characteristics (e.g., neurobiological, interpersonal, cognitive, and emotional factors) and environmental contexts (e.g., family, school, peer, early adversity, poverty) in the development of risk and resiliency. Application of etiological models and empirical findings to prevention and intervention approaches will be explored. Throughout the course, students will evaluate current research based upon theory, methodological rigor, and clinical impact.",

For example, what assumptions do we make about strangers and why are we so convinced these assumptions are correct? How does our culture affect our parenting choices and why do we hold them so fiercely? What assumptions do we make about the nature of memory and are these assumptions valid? Are there \"defensive moves\" that we make when we are challenged racially, even when we are committedly antiracist? And, if so, why?

Are students fundamentally transformed by their college experience, and if so, what specific features of college actually make a difference? Most people's ideas about the impact of college come from personal experience, and the strongly held views of journalists, filmmakers, college spokespeople, relatives and public figures. Those beliefs are often misguided. Yet research can help us develop an accurate picture of just what it is that college does and doesn't do. Drawing on films, popular books and articles, as well as research from across the subdisciplines within psychology, we will examine some of the most common beliefs, and then delve into the psychological evidence that supports or refutes them. Our goal will be to develop a scientifically-based understanding of the psychological impact of college, and redesign various features of college to reflect our conclusions. Empirical work on this topic presents unique methodological challenges, so we will also spend some time designing studies that overcome those challenges.",

This course will explore how God(s), spirits, ancestors, and other super-human beings have been seen, heard, and felt by humans. Instead of rehearsing now tired debates between believers and skeptics, this class will combine cognitive sciences approaches to the study of religion with new perspectives on the nature of ontology--the nature of being--to examine how God and other super-human beings exist in and through their effects upon humans. From this perspective, we'll see how, even if God(s) and other supernatural beings don't exist in the heavens, they nevertheless act in this world through they ways that humans experience them. The puzzle for us will be, how do God(s), spirits, and/or divine messengers act? How do we feel, see, or hear beings that might not be there? What kind of reality do God(s) and spirits have in such scenarios? What is the nature of their being?",

These are only a few of the fascinating questions that ancient readers and interpreters of the Book of Genesis asked and attempted to answer. The first ten chapters of Genesis present a tantalizingly brief narrative account of the earliest history of humankind. The text moves swiftly from the Creation to the Flood and its immediate aftermath, but this masterful economy of style leaves many details unexplained. This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions associated with the primeval history in the Genesis. Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to some continuations of these variant traditions in medieval literature, with particular attention to the material on the figures of Cain and Noah. \u003cI\u003eAll readings are in translation.\u003c/I\u003e",

Buddhist ideas and practices now seem ubiquitous, available even in the form of smartphone apps like Headspace and Ten Percent Happier. In this class, we'll explore how Buddhism came to be the profoundly important cultural force in American life that it is today. We'll read a variety of Buddhist-influenced literary texts, from the Beat poetry of the 1950s to contemporary novels like Ruth Ozeki's \u003cI\u003eA Tale for the Time Being\u003c/I\u003e. And we'll range far beyond the world of literature into other cultural domains in which Buddhism has had a deep impact, like environmentalism, psychotherapy, and Western attitudes towards death and dying. We'll also give special attention to the role that Buddhism is playing in the struggle for racial justice (from bell hooks to Black Lives Matter). And we'll engage in an experiential investigation of the benefits of incorporating contemplative practices like mindfulness into higher education: students will learn a variety of meditation techniques, and we'll spend time each week practicing and reflecting upon those practices. Students will be expected to maintain a daily meditation practice outside of class (10-15 minutes a day), with the help of one of those newfangled meditation apps no less! No prior experience with meditation is necessary. Just an open mind. (For detailed information about the format of this hybrid course, please visit: www.tinyurl.com/Engl239)",

Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly. The course will help students understand the depth of Jewish life in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and interrogate the local and global factors that led to their disappearance from both social and cultural memories for a long time. Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world. Resisting both conflict and nostalgia as the primary determinants of Jewish-Muslim relations, the course will help students think about multiple ways in which Jews and Muslims formed communities of citizens despite their differences and disagreements.",

We consider how mindfulness relates to Buddhist discourses and practices, and to the rapid rise of fields like contemplative neuroscience, affective neuroscience, and integrative neurobiology. How and why has the research on mindfulness and other applied meditative practices exploded since 2000? How has this research helped us understand and explain the intersection of mind, emotion, behavior, and human development? We critically examine the models of the mind developed by clinical and evolutionary psychologists and researchers in fields such as affective neuroscience to better understand the applications of mindfulness in the US today. Specifically, we consider how mindfulness and other forms of meditation are being used to improve the training of health care providers and educators, while augmenting and deepening the quality of their engagement with patients, students, and others they serve. We examine and train in a variety of meditation practices including mindfulness and forest bathing, while unpacking the subjective experience of our minds and emotions first-hand. Students will be asked to engage in mindfulness practices the entire semester.",

We will be particularly attuned to the ways in which these categories are performed through and maintained by rituals and how bodies are deployed in ritual spaces as instruments of persuasion and control. We will also look in depth at a variety of ritual forms, including scapegoating and sacrifice, and how they serve as engines of political control and protest, and we will examine the uses of dead bodies and memorials as vehicles for gaining and maintaining political power and the destruction and desecration of bodies and memorials as a form of political protest and dissent.

This course encourages students to look beyond modernist ideals of Buddhism as a rational tradition of monks, monasteries and manuscripts, merely advocating mindfulness. In this course, we take Buddhist \"stuff\" (material culture) seriously. We explore what exactly is material culture, and what makes it Buddhist? If Buddhism is supposed to be a tradition that encourages non-attachment, then what is meant by \"Buddhist material culture\"? Shouldn't Buddhists be free of material things? Or, rather, who says they have to be? This course offers: (1) an introduction to the core concepts of Buddhism; (2) a brief overview of Material Religion, or the \"material turn\" in the study of religion; and (3) a preliminary exploration into the vast material- and spiritual worlds of Buddhist Asia, particularly China, Japan, Myanmar, Tibet, and Thailand. We begin by decolonializing Buddhism (think \u003cI\u003emandala\u003c/I\u003e, not only meditation; or ghosts and spirits, not just \u003cI\u003esutra\u003c/I\u003e). Next, we trace religious studies trends that privilege material investigations that acknowledge the agency of not only humans but also the agency of objects/things/stuff, and that emphasizes the dynamics among people, things, and spirits. We learn about these dynamics by looking closely at Buddhist stuff. Things act upon us, and we (re)act upon them. They shape identity, create meaning, and maintain relationships. We will learn that things are never just things. They help us better understand what people do in Buddhism, not just what people believe. This course includes brief experiential components on Buddhist meditation and ritual. No prior experience in meditation or Buddhism is required. This course does not assume any previous background in Buddhism, Religion, Asian Studies, or Art History.",

To that end, we will consider the ties of transhumanism to eugenics and massive investments in pharmaceuticals, anti-aging medicine, and so-called \"GNR\" technologies (i.e. genetics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence and robotics); the movement's affinities with neoliberalism and what some have pointed to as transhumanism's racialized subtext of whiteness. We will furthermore devote considerable attention to the technological singularity, the figure of the cyborg, mind-uploading, space colonization, and cryonic suspension, all of which, like transhumanism broadly, suggest that science and technology have in some sense come to operate as powerful channeling agents for the very sorts of beliefs, practices, and forms of association that theorists of secularization expected modernity to displace. Lastly, throughout the course of the seminar we will take transhumanism as a provocation to think broadly and seriously about religion, technology, embodiment, and ways of being human.",

      "descriptionSearch": "Islam and Capitalism are two widely debated and yet increasingly elusive phenomena of our contemporary age. This course offers a chronological and thematic study of the conceptual and material entanglements between Islam and Capitalism. The mere juxtaposition of Islam and Capitalism is beset with conceptual difficulty and anachronism: can Islam be conceived as a religion proper given the Shari'a's extensive regulation of commercial life? Is faith in the providence of free markets akin to religious belief? Are Islam and Capitalism universal goods, or are they isomorphic to distinct cultures? Does the simultaneous rise of Islamic banking and \"halal\" consumerism signal a revolt against capitalist modernity, or does it mark the domestication of religion by forces of the market? How do Islamic conceptions of socioeconomic justice and ecological preservation respond to the environmental crises of Capitalism and the Anthropocene?\n\nWe will explore these questions and address their underlying assumptions from within the disciplinary frameworks of History, Anthropology, and Religious Studies. In terms of theory, students will comprehend key debates and methodological approaches to the broader study of religion and capitalism, including formal resemblances between theological concepts and theorizations of the market; the analytical purchase of binary oppositions between religion (enchantment) and economics (rationality); the cultural embeddedness of markets versus their formalistic autonomy; postcolonial critiques of corporate sovereignty and neoliberalism; and, finally, economic/ecological assemblages and \"religious economies.\"\n\nIn addition to harnessing theoretical tools of analysis, students will also acquire substantial knowledge of the Shari'a, its commercial laws, institutions, and contracts by studying the history of commerce in Muslim societies from 7th-century agrarianism to contemporary Islamic finance. The diverse topics, regions, and periods covered in the course are organized into 5 modules: (1) theoretical concepts in religion and economics; (2) the Shari'a and Islamic commercial law; (3) commerce in medieval Islam; (4) modernity, colonialism, and industrial capitalism; and, finally, (5) globalization, modern Islamic finance, and environmentalism.",

Gandhi is well known today for his philosophy of non-violent resistance and its application in India's freedom struggle as well as his influence on the work of leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. Hailed as the 'father of the Indian nation', however, Gandhi is not only known for his political ideas but also for his deep engagement with aspect of everyday human behavior and morality: truth, vegetarianism, sex and celibacy, to name just a few of his obsessions which contributed to making his broader philosophy. It is this commitment to a morally pure life that earned him the title of 'Mahatma' or Great Soul in India. This tutorial will focus on three key aspects of Gandhi: his ideas of peaceful protest as means of social and political change, his contemplations on moral philosophy, and on his legacy in modern India and the world. Students will read a combination of Gandhi's own writings as well as journal articles, monographs and films. The course will probe questions such as: What was the context and nature of Gandhian nationalism? Did it help to integrate the Indian nation? Was Gandhi truly a Great Soul, a saint or a shrewd politician? In what ways is Gandhi received and remembered by the Indian nation today? How does understanding a figure like Gandhi facilitate our understanding of modern nationalism, citizenship and political action?",

The fact that more than 55% of Earth's inhabitants live in urban settings today means that cities will be important actors in the fight against climate change moving forward. In this course, we will examine how cities from the French-speaking world (including in North America, Europe, and Africa, as well as along the Pacific Rim) are enacting solutions for sustainable living in their midst. Taking a cultural studies approach, we will examine a variety of sources--including literature, videos and films, press articles, government documents, academic analyses, websites, and artistic productions, among others--to understand the challenges each of these cities faces and the solutions each has introduced. In so doing, we will study how site-specific realities, such as (eco)tourism, the legacy of colonialism and imperialism, relations with indigenous populations, and inequalities (such as those of race, sex, gender expression, class, age, and ability), are interwoven with questions of sustainable development and ecological living.

These travels both contributed to the expansion of the known world for Europeans and also laid the foundations for commercial routes and colonisation. French travelers played a key role in this process and documented their journeys in detailed narratives. After reading short excerpts of earlier works that built the travel narrative genre, such as Ibn Battuta's Travels and Marco Polo's Book of Marvels, we will read longer excerpts from Jacques Cartier's Brief narration of the Navigation to the Islands of Canada, Jean de Léry's History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Pierre Belon's Voyage to the Levant, and study the maps that were created during this time period. We will analyze the representation of the journey itself, the descriptions of the lands traveled to and their inhabitants, and also the enunciation of the goals of such travels. We will see how a rhetoric of fascination, wonder and curiosity is intertwined with economical, political and religious agendas. There is no \"official\" travel narrative written by a woman in this time period: we will wonder why and study the representation of women in these texts. Conducted in French.",

We will consider how literary and philosophical texts from the aforementioned time periods depict nature, how real-world interactions with nature led to the creation of (illustrated) taxonomies, how colonization inflected notions of the natural world and also museum exhibits, and finally, how the cabinet of curiosities and later, the museum, provided a space in which to display and analyze nature's more unusual treasures.

This course will also offer an exploration of Italy's lesser-known cultural and natural sites in an attempt to highlight what Italy has to offer in terms of eco-friendly and sustainable tourism and cultural diversity. In the wake of the \u003cI\u003eBlack Lives Matter's\u003c/I\u003e quest for social justice, a part of this course will be dedicated to Italian black writers and artists to explore how the Italian colonial past is affecting Italy's racial discourse and the construction of its national identity.\n\nStudents will review and expand the grammar structures learned in the previous semesters to achieve a higher level of fluency and sophistication in language production. Italian 105 is intended for study-abroad returnees and other advanced speakers; students who have been particularly successful in Italian 101-102 are also encouraged to enroll.\n\nThis will be an online course, with a mix of synchronous and asynchronous elements. Students will meet twice a week in small groups of 4-6 students. Students will have the option to practice oral communication through 30-minute weekly conversations with native speakers available on the online platform Talkabroad.",

Barcelona, immortalized for world audiences in George Orwell's classic \u003cI\u003eHomage to Catalonia\u003c/I\u003e(1938), has a complicated political and cultural history. Catalans have a fascinating and unique culture and language. Their identity has often been cause for political unrest in their relationship with the rest of Spain, and even amongst Catalans themselves. In recent years, tensions with Spain's capital, Madrid, home to the central government and the Royal family, have filled headlines and divided politicians and even families.\n\nIn this senior seminar we will focus on these two cities in their own right, and explore the counterpoints between them. We will consider the historical roots of lesser known aspects of Catalan culture and identity in order to tease out some of the myriad perspectives that are at play in Spain today.\n\nMaterials will come from many different media: historical pieces, music, art and architecture, classic novels and films, recent fiction and essays by second generation authors who have been raised by immigrant parents in both cities, and media pieces. We will also invite cultural observers and players to be guest speakers and help us stay up to date as we follow this ever evolving relationship that keeps journalists and politicians on tenterhooks.",

And how do these encounters with difference impact current events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the persistent tensions between East and West Germans? This tutorial will examine new dilemmas through ethnographic studies and documentary films that aim to capture in real time the process of articulating and grappling with newly discovered divides. We will focus especially closely on Russia, but will also read studies on East Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine.

      "descriptionSearch": "On Christmas Day 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev ended two things: his tenure as President of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union itself. In the years that followed, the Soviet Union's fifteen national republics splintered overnight into more than a dozen nation states along uneven and highly contest ethnic lines. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin assumed office as the first president of the Russian Federation, and without delay, began to institute radical economic and social reforms. Under his watch, the country privatized national industry, cut the state budget, and courted foreign multinational businesses. The world most commonly used to describe Russia in the early 1990s is \"disappear\": money, jobs, food, and people. The very things that Soviet-style socialism had committed itself to providing for started to vanish as a result of invisible and market forces. Russian nationalism replaced Soviet internationalism as a guiding national idea. This course will explore what emerged in the spaces left empty after Soviet-style socialism's demise in three parts. The first part of the semester will examine the origins of the Soviet Union's collapse and its breakup into fifteen successor states. The second part of the semester will survey the political, economic, and social processes that followed the collapse. Finally, the third part of the course will focus on Putin's ascendancy to the presidency and its consequences for Russian citizens at home and Russia's image abroad. Three themes will occupy a prominent place in the course: political-economy, nationalism, and identity. By semester's end, students will have acquired the content and analytical literacy to place the former Soviet Union in its specific historical context and identify multiple sources of causation that may help explain Russia's transition from socialism to capitalism to Putinism during the past quarter century.",

We will discuss a wide range of aspects of family life: the relationship between arranged marriage and romantic relationship, the role of inheritance in family and social life, the distribution of resources in the context of modern family forms (most notably remarriages), and the outsourcing of care for dependents. Intimacy bears different value and content in these changing contexts.\nThe course will further look into the changing character of new economy where \"people's skills\" are ever more required from employees (emotional labor) and where intimacy, care, and/or sex constitute purchasable commodities. A reflection on the growth of new technologies will complicate some of the discussed concepts and notions, but throughout a common denominator of our discussion will be the role of social inequality.",

From CCTV cameras, to supermarket loyalty cards, to the massive gathering of personal data on social media sites, people participate in today's \"surveillance societies\" just by doing everyday activities. This course uses the metaphor of the \"Panopticon\" as a doorway to engagement with traditional and new forms of surveillance. First described by philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham, the Panopticon is a physical structure that enables one observer to see all inhabitants without those inhabitants knowing when they are being observed. In \u003cem\u003eDiscipline and Punish\u003c/em\u003e, Michel Foucault famously expanded thinking on the Panopticon as a metaphor for the \"disciplinary\" power that lies at the heart of inequality in modern society. Since Bentham and Foucault's time, however, surveillance technologies have changed significantly. To what extent does the concept of the Panopticon give us purchase on today's surveillance societies? How does watching people with new digital and algorithmic surveillance technologies shape the exercise of power and, in turn, (re)produce forms of inequality? Can privacy, convenience, and safety ever be truly balanced? Topics include: the historical origins and expansion of surveillance in modern societies, the emerging total surveillance state in Baltimore City, and whether social media is turning us all into self-surveillance addicts.",

Putting aside for a moment the very reasonable doubts about how justified this perception actually was, it is still worth asking, how did people who lived in the world in which differences in rank, class, gender or ethnicity were not supposed to matter, make sense of their postsocialist condition, one in which new forms of difference emerged, and old ones assumed greater prominence? And how do these encounters with difference impact current events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the persistent tensions between East and West Germans? This tutorial will examine new dilemmas through ethnographic studies and documentary films that aim to capture in real time the process of articulating and grappling with newly discovered divides. We will focus especially closely on Russia, but will also read studies on East Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine. This course fulfills the DPE requirement by exploring comparatively the ways in which people in different countries made sense of the social, cultural and political heterogeneity of the postsocialist condition.",

In this three-part course, students engage with global capitalism's past, present, and future, asking analytic and normative questions about work and the trajectory of capitalism. The first part of the course examines the historical origins of capitalism and leading theories about what capitalism is and how it stratifies the world into racialized social classes. A central theme in part one will be how capitalist labor relations shape meaning and subjectivity, particularly the experience of dignity. In part two, we examine recent and emerging trends in capitalist labor, such as the death of the career, the rise of the \"gig\" economy, platform capitalism, and even the seemingly inevitable end of work itself as entire occupations become automated by machine learning. A key question will be how these transformations exacerbate and/or alleviate longstanding inequalities from capitalism's 19th century past. The course concludes by asking students to imagine what work might look like in the next century. Should we continue to work at all? What kinds of social activity should we value, and how would we go about taming, eroding, or even smashing capitalism to allow them to flourish?",

To that end, we will consider the ties of transhumanism to eugenics and massive investments in pharmaceuticals, anti-aging medicine, and so-called \"GNR\" technologies (i.e. genetics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence and robotics); the movement's affinities with neoliberalism and what some have pointed to as transhumanism's racialized subtext of whiteness. We will furthermore devote considerable attention to the technological singularity, the figure of the cyborg, mind-uploading, space colonization, and cryonic suspension, all of which, like transhumanism broadly, suggest that science and technology have in some sense come to operate as powerful channeling agents for the very sorts of beliefs, practices, and forms of association that theorists of secularization expected modernity to displace. Lastly, throughout the course of the seminar we will take transhumanism as a provocation to think broadly and seriously about religion, technology, embodiment, and ways of being human.",

Stories, in this view, are not only the stuff of literature, but also the very fabric of social life: the foundation for individual and collective identities. This course grapples with the role of stories and storytelling in modern social life. What role do stories play in constituting personal identity? What cultural templates structure the stories we tell? Why are memoirs so popular, and how can we explain the more recent resurgence of interest in oral forms of storytelling? What role does storytelling play in politics and social movements? Specific topics will include confessional culture, podcasts, memoir, politics, and social change. Along the way, we will pay explicit attention to medium, and consider how sociologists might learn from journalists, documentarians, and memoirists to convey stories from their own research.",

Indeed, the Bayesian approach is now recognized across scientific disciples as a modern and powerful tool. We begin with an introduction to Bayes' Theorem, the theoretical underpinning of Bayesian statistics which dates back to the 1700's, and the concepts of prior and posterior distributions, conjugacy, and closed-form Bayesian inference. Building on this, we introduce modern computational approaches to performing Bayesian inference, including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Metropolis-Hastings sampling, and the theory underlying these simple and powerful methods, before moving on to multivariate sampling methods and methodology. Students will become comfortable with modern software tools for MCMC using a variety of applied hierarchical modeling examples, and will use R for all statistical computing. The course will culminate in an independent Bayesian research project.",

From CCTV cameras, to supermarket loyalty cards, to the massive gathering of personal data on social media sites, people participate in today's \"surveillance societies\" just by doing everyday activities. This course uses the metaphor of the \"Panopticon\" as a doorway to engagement with traditional and new forms of surveillance. First described by philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham, the Panopticon is a physical structure that enables one observer to see all inhabitants without those inhabitants knowing when they are being observed. In \u003cem\u003eDiscipline and Punish\u003c/em\u003e, Michel Foucault famously expanded thinking on the Panopticon as a metaphor for the \"disciplinary\" power that lies at the heart of inequality in modern society. Since Bentham and Foucault's time, however, surveillance technologies have changed significantly. To what extent does the concept of the Panopticon give us purchase on today's surveillance societies? How does watching people with new digital and algorithmic surveillance technologies shape the exercise of power and, in turn, (re)produce forms of inequality? Can privacy, convenience, and safety ever be truly balanced? Topics include: the historical origins and expansion of surveillance in modern societies, the emerging total surveillance state in Baltimore City, and whether social media is turning us all into self-surveillance addicts.",

It has disrupted our lives and laid bare the racial, gendered and economic inequalities in our health system, and the deficiencies of political and public health institutions, as it continues to claim more victims.\nFor centuries, communicable diseases ravaged different communities and led to massive mortality and morbidity. The death toll disrupted social organizations, destroyed families and communities, and challenged medical institutions and State authority. Medical thought and practice struggled to make sense of contagion, disease factors and treatment; State authorities were faced with demands to intervene, protect and support the sick, all while its own institutions were ravaged by diseases; race, gender, sexuality and other human differences were deployed to justify why some died more, and to show that, for the State, some lives mattered more than others.\n\nIn this course, we trace how epidemics influenced the history of medicine, science and technology, and how they impacted social structures around the world. We ask about the meaning of contagion, how medical and scientific thought understood diseases. We investigate the history of quarantines and isolations. We ask about race, gender and sexuality and their place in the making of epidemics, and we investigate the history of colonialism and its connection to changing disease landscape. Tracing epidemics from the nineteenth century plagues to COVID, the course investigates the place of epidemics and contagion in medical and scientific thought, how they relate to race, gender, sexuality and colonialism, and how they changed and shaped the world we live in.",

      "descriptionSearch": "In ancient Greece, Democritus took his ontological bearings by atoms he took not to come to be, change, or pass away, but to move and interconnect in space so as to compose everything else. Plato also took his ontological bearings by entities that do not change, but ones that are not in space or time: mathematical structures and, at least aspirationally, the forms or ideas of the good, the beautiful, etc. Aristotle, finally, took his ontological bearings by temporal entities, i.e., organisms. In these terms, modern science combines central teachings of Democritus and Plato: the universe is understood as a mechanism whose components--ultimately, atoms--interact in ways governed by mathematical laws, and--for Descartes and his followers--animals, too, are machines rather than organisms. Hence, Laplace's (1814) thesis that \"An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.\" This deterministic, mechanistic, and reductionist way of thinking has, for the past several hundred years, powerfully influenced such diverse fields as philosophy, biology, and economics. Over the past few decades, however, it has been challenged by new discoveries, particularly in physics and biology, and by theoreticians in a variety of disciplines. These theoreticians focus on complex, dynamic systems as, in one terminology, wholes that are more than the sums of their constituents. In this tutorial, we examine some of the most promising and intriguing trends in this potentially revolutionary movement. Our central focus will be on autopoietic systems, i.e., entities that subsist over time despite changing their material constituents. The smallest such entities are cells, but the tissues, organs, and organisms of which many cells are constituents are also autopoietic systems, as are yet more complex entities such as universities, economies, ecosystems, and states. The process ontology required by autopoietic systems is a radical alternative to the ontology that has been dominant for the past several centuries. It has many exciting implications for various subdisciplines in philosophy and for various academic disciplines beyond philosophy.",

We consider how mindfulness relates to Buddhist discourses and practices, and to the rapid rise of fields like contemplative neuroscience, affective neuroscience, and integrative neurobiology. How and why has the research on mindfulness and other applied meditative practices exploded since 2000? How has this research helped us understand and explain the intersection of mind, emotion, behavior, and human development? We critically examine the models of the mind developed by clinical and evolutionary psychologists and researchers in fields such as affective neuroscience to better understand the applications of mindfulness in the US today. Specifically, we consider how mindfulness and other forms of meditation are being used to improve the training of health care providers and educators, while augmenting and deepening the quality of their engagement with patients, students, and others they serve. We examine and train in a variety of meditation practices including mindfulness and forest bathing, while unpacking the subjective experience of our minds and emotions first-hand. Students will be asked to engage in mindfulness practices the entire semester.",

To that end, we will consider the ties of transhumanism to eugenics and massive investments in pharmaceuticals, anti-aging medicine, and so-called \"GNR\" technologies (i.e. genetics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence and robotics); the movement's affinities with neoliberalism and what some have pointed to as transhumanism's racialized subtext of whiteness. We will furthermore devote considerable attention to the technological singularity, the figure of the cyborg, mind-uploading, space colonization, and cryonic suspension, all of which, like transhumanism broadly, suggest that science and technology have in some sense come to operate as powerful channeling agents for the very sorts of beliefs, practices, and forms of association that theorists of secularization expected modernity to displace. Lastly, throughout the course of the seminar we will take transhumanism as a provocation to think broadly and seriously about religion, technology, embodiment, and ways of being human.",

Students will use an array of ethnographic techniques such as observant participation, interviewing, focus groups, and qualitative surveys to explore our campus community comprised of students, faculty, and/or staff, that build on weekly discussions, feedback, and design exercises. We situate our campus health projects within the wider context of how power and intersectionality inflect and structure health and well-being locally and globally. Our case studies explore how structural racism shapes medical education, pediatric care, and maternity care in the US, how the spread of US psychiatry inflects the landscape of global mental health, and how queer activism responded to the HIV/AIDS crisis. We consider how disruptive moments like COVID-19 or HIV/AIDS can serve as focal moments in social history that reveal underlying inequalities of health outcomes and access. We attend to the parallel roles of narrative in medicine and ethnography, as we contrast the discourse of providers \u0026 patients as well as researchers \u0026 interlocutors. Throughout our goal is to better understand the strengths and limits of ethnographic inquiry while exploring the challenges of collaborative and participatory research within communities always already structured by power, privilege, and engaged practices.",

Through readings, audiovisual materials, performance exercises, and discussions we will engage with theatre as a constantly evolving art form, sharpening our analytical skills through theoretical approaches from performance studies. Central to our exploration will be excavating the Eurocentric assumptions that conventionally shape the practice and study of theater in the United States. We will seek ways to decolonize our perspectives and ask critical questions about performance's potential to enact strategies of anti-racism and anti-imperialism. As a capstone project, students will create virtual performances.

      "descriptionSearch": "The Buddha is said to have identified three things that cannot stay hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. What's the secret? Who is lying? Who is breaking the rules? American drama abounds with hidden knowledge and false representations. (This is not surprising: theatre is always on some level a deceptive practice, a place where one person pretends to be another, and where what is spoken is always open to skeptical scrutiny. We might say theatre is always lying as much as lying is always theatre.) This tutorial course will examine what lies hidden in American plays from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Beginning with excerpted critical and historical writings on secrecy and lying (\u003cI\u003eThe Adventures of Pinocchio\u003c/I\u003e, Machiavelli's \u003cI\u003eThe Prince\u003c/I\u003e, Thomas Carlson's \u003cI\u003eLying and Deception: Theory and Practice\u003c/I\u003e, among others), we will proceed to a set of American plays from across a wide spectrum of playwrights, including Eugene O'Neill, Edward Albee, Sarah Ruhl, Arthur Miller, Amy Herzog, Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, Annie Baker, and others.  Student papers will explore how hidden knowledge structures dramatic action, how different characters create and respond to untruths, and what can we learn in particular from \u003cI\u003eAmerican\u003c/I\u003e drama about a national relationship to honesty and its opposites. For Fall 2020, the tutorial will be conducted primarily online. Depending on enrollments, we may divide into groups with three students, instead of the traditional two-student tutorial format.",

On the other hand, we will examine the role digital communication platforms play in political resistance. We will apply our growing understanding of the pitfalls and potential of digital technologies to examining the aesthetic strategies and political projects of artists and their audiences from various parts of the world. Throughout our work we will acknowledge how access to new technologies, as well as the meaning given to their use, vary between national, cultural, and class contexts.

With an emphasis on the flow of story arc over time, we will examine existing texts with episodic and sequential structures (such as picture books, comics, albums, film, theater, and opera) and interpret them into storyboards of various 2D and/or 3D visual media. The focus here is on developing and communicating complete dramaturgically-based visual ideas with an eye towards big-picture concepts. This class is geared towards all students interested in time-based visual narratives such as directing/designing/creating/writing for film and theater. No previous artistic expertise is required, but know that the bulk of the work here will be hands-on art projects, presentations, and group critique and discussion in a studio art class format.\n\nWe will discuss the particulars of the hybrid format as a class this fall, to make sure everyone is comfortable and responsive to CDC requirements.",

Theatre Majors are required to participate in four department productions, and must serve as stage manager for one of them. Depending on their role in the production process, students will be admitted to Theatre Production courses by permission of the department Chair, following casting and the assembly of the artistic and production team. Students may participate in a production in one of three major roles: stage management, performing (actor or actress, musician, dancer, etc.), or non-performing (director, designer, dramaturge, choreographer, music director, production manager, etc.). Stage managers or performers should expect to be in rehearsals, generally scheduled during the evening hours from 6-10PM, for up to twenty hours per week during a five to ten-week long production process, as well as up to ten hours per day during tech weekend and up to six hours per day during the performance run of the show. Non-performing roles may be expected to be involved in the production process before the start of rehearsals, participating in meetings, auditions, as well as a post-mortem process for each show. Entrance into a production for actors and major artistic roles are based on competitive auditions or prior experience. There is no online registration. Repeatable course numbers are designated as follows: 291 (Stage Management Production I); 292 (Stage Management Production II); 293 (Stage Management Production III); 294 (Performing Role Production I); 295 (Performing Role Production II); 296 (Performing Role Production III); 297 (Non-Performing Role Production I); 298 (Non-Performing Role Production II); 299 (Non-Performing Role Production III).

This course provides students with an overview of theatre's many diverse histories, emphasizing its dual role as both an artistic and social practice. While attending to theatre's formal and aesthetic aspects, we will at the same time focus on the relationship of performance practices to the legacies of state power, hegemony, imperialism, and colonialism in which they are historically embedded. Topics of inquiry may include: classical Greek and Roman theatre; dance/drama of pre-colonial Africa; Indian classical drama; pre-modern theatres of Japan; Medieval and Renaissance theatre in England; Pre-Columbian indigenous performance practices; French and Spanish court theatres; German nationalist theatre; nineteenth-century popular performance in the U.S.; and the rise of realist theatre in Scandinavia. Through close analysis and interpretation of primary sources, including encounters with archival sources housed in Chapin and WCMA and also available in digital form, students will practice and learn the skills of the theatre historian, applying them to their own creative and critical research projects.

Each week, we will examine a performance at the limit of action, including silence, sexual abjection, concealment, melancholia, and waiting, alongside issues related to race, gender, sexuality, labor, and migration among others. How might we approach and reconcile with performances that once again reify notions of racialized and gendered bodies as apolitical, passive, submissive, and compliant? Drawing on scholarship within black and women of color feminist criticism, queer of color critique, critical ethnic studies, and performance studies, this course will attune students to the role of aesthetics to interrogate and expand what we typically conceive of as activism, resistance, power, and survival from racialized, feminized, and queer positions.",

Spectacles may be live shows, media events, or even everyday performances ranging from interactive advertisements to viral video sensations. But what are the uses of spectacle? Why are some compelling while others fall flat? How do spectacles control society or maintain social norms? And, importantly for our purposes, how does spectacle shape gender in society? Or from another angle, how does sexuality infuse spectacle? This tutorial introduces students to theories of spectacle ranging from the ancient Greeks to Marxist-inspired thinkers in the 20th century. In particular, we will examine how feminist thinkers have contributed to this literature and how theories of spectacle relate to questions of gender and sexuality. Our weekly readings focus on pairings of theoretical readings with writing on popular cultural examples and case studies. Some possible topics include sporting events, charity ad campaigns, music videos, political events, and social media.",

      "descriptionSearch": "The practice of colorism, or skin color discrimination, is very familiar to people of color globally. Often described as intra-racial racism, colorism within the Black American context is part of the colonial legacy of institutionalized slavery where the vestiges of white supremacy have created color castes among Blacks that still, to this day, have serious consequences for those on the darkest end of the color spectrum. The impact of this practice is far-reaching, influencing everything from romantic partnering, economic and educational attainment, and perceptions of beauty, attractiveness, and criminality. Although the vast majority of colorism scholarship is empirically based, there is much that we can glean from a literary investigation of this practice by analyzing the works of renowned writer, theorist, and folklorist Toni Morrison. Her work is particularly useful in examining issues of skin color, as this topic has been persistent yet underexplored in Morrison's writings. Employing the methods of literary and rhetorical criticism, this tutorial will investigate five Morrison novels, The \u003cem\u003eBluest Eye\u003c/em\u003e (1970), \u003cem\u003eSula\u003c/em\u003e (1973), \u003cem\u003eSong of Solomon\u003c/em\u003e (1977), \u003cem\u003eLove\u003c/em\u003e (2003) and \u003cem\u003eGod Help the Child\u003c/em\u003e (2015), and some of her non-fiction writings. In our discussions of each text, we will examine the problem of the \"color complex\" at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class and sexual violence, and how the characters manage these overlapping issues. We will bring the novels into conversation with social science articles on the practices of colorism in daily life. Because the tutorial blends different kinds of investigations into colorism, it will equip first year students with tools to critically engage and interrogate fictional literature; help them identify the real and nuanced ways that color discrimination affects Black communities; and consider how Morrison, one of our foremost writers, bridges literary creativity with ethnographic observation.",

      "descriptionSearch": "Capitalism has a way of constricting our imaginations so that we come to believe the only possible form of economic institution is one based on profit seeking, competition and individualism. However movements in countries including Brazil, France, Canada and Spain--and now parts of the U.S.--are demonstrating otherwise. Theorists, practitioners and social activists are adopting labels including 'Solidarity Economy' and 'New Economy' to group together economic activities based on ideals of human provisioning, social justice and environmental sustainability. They point out that many of these activities are already taking place and are often crucial to our lives, but are rendered invisible by economic theory. In the words of Brazilian popular educator and economist Marcos Arruda, 'a solidarity economy does not arise from thinkers or ideas; it is the outcome of the concrete historical struggle of the human being to live and to develop him/herself as an individual and a collective.'  Feminist geographers Julie Graham and Katherine Gibson developed practices of 'mapping' local economies with communities in Australia and Western Massachusetts in ways that bring to light the invisible resources and practices of provisioning and solidarity, and challenge what they describe, drawing on the work of feminist theorist Sharon Marcus, as a 'script' of local helplessness to resist the 'rape' of their economies by the forces of global capitalism. Do these proposed discursive practices actually present realistic possibilities for producing sustained economic change? In this tutorial we will learn and debate about some of the activities being named and built under the label of solidarity economy, such as the networks of worker-owned cooperatives in Mondragon, Spain, the growth of local currencies and time exchanges, fair trade organizations and different ways of organizing care work. We will look at some of the history and debates around worker-owned cooperatives, ranging from Victorian England through African-American experiences throughout the 20th century and examples in post-Independence Africa, to the recent establishment of Cooperation Jackson in Jackson, Mississippi. The ILO has argued that co-ops are a particularly appropriate form to African development. Is this plausible, and what role might they play in AIDS-affected communities? Why has the recent U.S. growth of the solidarity economy been so concentrated in communities of color, and how is it gendered? We will visit some examples in New York or Boston.",

Actual illnesses, from tuberculosis to AIDS to the Novel Coronavirus, constitute not only social realities that trouble political and popular minds in their own right; but further provide powerful metaphors for exploring issues of human rights, national identity, and transnational circulation. This course examines how Chinese literature in the 20th and 21st centuries writes and visualizes \"illness\"--a universal human experience that is nevertheless heavily bounded by culture and history. Specifically, we examine the cultural and social meaning of \"illness\"; the relationship between illness on the one hand, and the politics of body, gender, and class on the other; we ask how infectious disease, and mental illness are defined, represented, and understood in both male and female writers' analytical essays and fictional writings in the 20th century; we examine how metaphorical \"illness\" such as infectious cannibalism and fin-de-siècle \"viruses,\" are imagined and interpreted by key culture figures ranging from the founding father of modern literature (Lu Xun), to the winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature (Mo Yan). Throughout the course, we will focus on the interplay between literature canons (fictions, essays, and dramas) and popular media and genres: blockbuster cinemas and art house films, popular novels, photographs and posters, etc.",

This course maps out some of the intellectual and political interventions of Indigenous feminists in analyzing and struggling against genocide, heteropatriarchy, conquest and racial capitalism in settler states like the US and Canada. This course will focus on how Indigenous women, Two Spirit and trans people have analyzed and struggled against the imposition of colonial constructs of gender and sexuality that mark Indigenous lives and lands as sites of extraction. It will examine how carceral regimes of control produced by the intertwined histories of conquest and Transatlantic slavery have been imposed upon Indigenous lives through the child protection system and the prison industrial complex. Students will be invited to consider how Indigenous feminist practices 'make a future' (Brant 1981) against and beyond the settler state. This course aims to familiarize students with historical and contemporary Indigenous feminist works, as well as provide an overview of Indigenous feminist political formations, poetry, fiction, and making practices. Pedagogically, this course will also facilitate the development and sharpening of skills in social analysis, writing and argumentation.",

Each week, we will examine a performance at the limit of action, including silence, sexual abjection, concealment, melancholia, and waiting, alongside issues related to race, gender, sexuality, labor, and migration among others. How might we approach and reconcile with performances that once again reify notions of racialized and gendered bodies as apolitical, passive, submissive, and compliant? Drawing on scholarship within black and women of color feminist criticism, queer of color critique, critical ethnic studies, and performance studies, this course will attune students to the role of aesthetics to interrogate and expand what we typically conceive of as activism, resistance, power, and survival from racialized, feminized, and queer positions.",

Each unit, we will study key scholarship that centers reproduction, slavery, care and domestic work, indentured servitude, sex work, and low wage flexible labor, to name a few, alongside queer and feminist modes of performance that respond to and/or provide strategies to live and survive under racial capitalism. We will discuss seminal works by theorists, including Karl Marx, Luce Irigaray, Cedric Robinson, Jennifer Morgan, Hortense Spillers, Lisa Lowe, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Dorothy Roberts, Angela Davis, José Esteban Muñoz, and Leo Bersani, in tandem with performances, such as paintings, performance art, poetry, protests, photography, prints, music, and sculptures.

Topics include: ways of thinking about the queer past; women's \"friendships\" in Victorian Britain; the role of the new science of sexology in specifying various \"sexual perversions\"; the rise of sexual undergrounds in the context of European urbanization; the birth of campaigns for \"homosexual emancipation\"; attempts to regulate and suppress \"deviant\" sexualities, especially under the fascist and Nazi regimes in the 1930s; the effects of the postwar consumer revolution on the practices of sexual selfhood; the postwar \"sex change\" debates; the politics of 1950s homophile organizing and the 1970s Gay Liberation Movement; and recent debates about migrant queer identities in an increasingly multicultural Europe. The course will focus primarily on experiences in Britain, France, and Germany, but with some detours to Italy and Russia. Readings will be drawn from sexological texts, political tracts, memoirs, and the writings of recent historians and theorists. Several films will be screened and will also be central to our discussions of the changing meanings of sexual selfhood in modern European societies.",

Shaking off its early disrepute, and taking advantage of growing literacy and innovations in production and distribution, it achieved in this period an unrivalled synthesis of mass appeal and aesthetic and social ambition. Its representational aspirations were breathtaking: attempting to comprehend in its pages the dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as to delineate in finest detail the texture of individual lives and minds. In an age obsessed with the social, it engaged directly with the most compelling issues of the day, including industrialization and the gap between rich and poor, the role of women, nationalism and imperialism, and more broadly, the very nature of historical change itself. But it did so, for the most part, by telling fine-grained stories of ordinary men and women, people trying to make a living, worrying about their families and their neighbors, facing illness and death, and falling in--and sometimes out of--love. Since so many of these stories remain highly accessible works of popular culture, we will work hard to focus on what is strange and specific about the fiction of the nineteenth century, while also recognizing the roots of much that is modern in our own culture. We will also take seriously their social ambitions, looking especially at the ways they formulate, promote, and contest their readers' understanding of themselves as subjects and agents of an ongoing social history. Likely authors include Jane Austen, Walter Scott, Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, and George Eliot.",

We situate our campus health projects within the wider context of how power and intersectionality inflect and structure health and well-being locally and globally. Our case studies explore how structural racism shapes medical education, pediatric care, and maternity care in the US, how the spread of US psychiatry inflects the landscape of global mental health, and how queer activism responded to the HIV/AIDS crisis. We consider how disruptive moments like COVID-19 or HIV/AIDS can serve as focal moments in social history that reveal underlying inequalities of health outcomes and access. We attend to the parallel roles of narrative in medicine and ethnography, as we contrast the discourse of providers \u0026 patients as well as researchers \u0026 interlocutors. Throughout our goal is to better understand the strengths and limits of ethnographic inquiry while exploring the challenges of collaborative and participatory research within communities always already structured by power, privilege, and engaged practices.",
